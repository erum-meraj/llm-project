https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/327116/ovarian-cancer-overwhelmed,"hi, my wife is presumably to have ovarian cancer.
 big belly, bloating and loss of appetite started about one month ago.
 Went to primary doc, then did an Ultrasound about 3 weeks ago, it showed 3cm pancreatic tumor and ascites. Scheduled for a CT scan the following week. Then her bloating/cough got much worse so we checked into the ER about 3 days after ultrasound.
 In the ER, they did CT scan, biopsy, paracenthesis and bloodwork on 9/22. it showed she has two tumors about 10cm x 10 cm in pelvis area, one on each side. Her CA-125 is at 15085. Pancreas are normal. Still waiting for biopsy results.
 Had first consultation with an oncologist who has a clinic next to the ER hospital on 9/25. He suggested 3 rounds of chemo then surgical removal if biopsy result confirms it's ovarian cancer.
 We also went back to the ER on 9/28 to do a thoracenthesis to drain fluid from her left lung, waiting for appointment to do her right lung.
 She's having really bad constipation and severe bloating from anything she eats. She's already taking
 docusate (stool softener) 2. simethicone (antigas) 3. spironolactone (water pill)
 She's been eating very little, just one or two cups of chopped watermelon, a few spoonfuls of wheat noodle, that's about it.
 some questions so far:
 anything we can do about the bloating and what can she eat to avoid the severe bloating? she's cut out all diaries now, they seem to be the most troublesome
 what is the typical tumor size that's too big for surgery w/o shrinking it by chemo. We're hoping she can just go straight to surgery.
 We're in SoCal near Long Beach area. Is City of Hope a good place to get second opinion or cancer treatment? what about UCLA Irvine?
 Thanks in advance.",hi my wife is presumably to have ovarian cancer big belly bloating and loss of appetite started about one month ago went to primary doc then did an ultrasound about 3 weeks ago it showed 3cm pancreatic tumor and ascites scheduled for a ct scan the following week then her bloatingcough got much worse so we checked into the er about 3 days after ultrasound in the er they did ct scan biopsy paracenthesis and bloodwork on 922 it showed she has two tumors about 10cm x 10 cm in pelvis area one on each side her ca125 is at 15085 pancreas are normal still waiting for biopsy results had first consultation with an oncologist who has a clinic next to the er hospital on 925 he suggested 3 rounds of chemo then surgical removal if biopsy result confirms its ovarian cancer we also went back to the er on 928 to do a thoracenthesis to drain fluid from her left lung waiting for appointment to do her right lung shes having really bad constipation and severe bloating from anything she eats shes already taking docusate stool softener 2 simethicone antigas 3 spironolactone water pill shes been eating very little just one or two cups of chopped watermelon a few spoonfuls of wheat noodle thats about it some questions so far anything we can do about the bloating and what can she eat to avoid the severe bloating shes cut out all diaries now they seem to be the most troublesome what is the typical tumor size thats too big for surgery wo shrinking it by chemo were hoping she can just go straight to surgery were in socal near long beach area is city of hope a good place to get second opinion or cancer treatment what about ucla irvine thanks in advance,"docusate, simethicone, spironolactone",Yes,High,"big belly, bloating, loss of appetite, constipation, severe bloating","big belly, bloating, severe bloating"
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/257442/doxil-stomach-cramps-anyone,"There have been a few different conversations on here about doxil and side effects - most recently the rash which I do have. However my main problem now seems to be with severe stomach cramps. The kind where you curl up in a ball and hold your breath until the pain subsides. Ugh!
 I have had four rounds of Doxil. I first had the cramping after the third round. It was so bad over a weekend I nearly called my doctor and went to the emergency room. So we had a sonogram done to make sure I didn't have anything else going on - like gall stones. Gall stones!!??? I don't have time for gall stones! LOL! Anyway I do not have gall stones. 
 The pain starts about a week after my treatment and can last several days - really bad first day or two then subsides over time. Actual pain which comes and goes and lots of tenderness to the touch or when I move - like roll over in bed. Since I have had it the last two times I am guessing this is going to be pretty much standard opperating procedure for me and Doxil. 
 I have read one of the more rare side effects (less than 1%) is internal inflamation and sometimes internal blistering of the colon and bile duct tubing going from the gall bladder (or something like that). Well that sounds pretty much like whats going on. Woo hoo. I can't just have the normal run of the mill side effects like hand and feet blistering and mouth sores. Oh no I have to have some bizarre exotic reaction! 
 After the third treatment because of this and the skin rash was so bad we discussed decreasing the dose - but I opted for at least one more at full strength. If it keeps working and things don't get too much worse I figure I will put up with it for a while before switching to something else. 
 Anyone else experience this with doxil?",there have been a few different conversations on here about doxil and side effects most recently the rash which i do have however my main problem now seems to be with severe stomach cramps the kind where you curl up in a ball and hold your breath until the pain subsides ugh i have had four rounds of doxil i first had the cramping after the third round it was so bad over a weekend i nearly called my doctor and went to the emergency room so we had a sonogram done to make sure i didnt have anything else going on like gall stones gall stones i dont have time for gall stones lol anyway i do not have gall stones the pain starts about a week after my treatment and can last several days really bad first day or two then subsides over time actual pain which comes and goes and lots of tenderness to the touch or when i move like roll over in bed since i have had it the last two times i am guessing this is going to be pretty much standard opperating procedure for me and doxil i have read one of the more rare side effects less than 1 is internal inflamation and sometimes internal blistering of the colon and bile duct tubing going from the gall bladder or something like that well that sounds pretty much like whats going on woo hoo i cant just have the normal run of the mill side effects like hand and feet blistering and mouth sores oh no i have to have some bizarre exotic reaction after the third treatment because of this and the skin rash was so bad we discussed decreasing the dose but i opted for at least one more at full strength if it keeps working and things dont get too much worse i figure i will put up with it for a while before switching to something else anyone else experience this with doxil,Doxil,Yes,High,"rash, severe stomach cramps, internal inflammation, internal blistering of the colon, tenderness to the touch, hand and feet blistering, mouth sores","rash, mouth sores"

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/327591/ca125-11-718-u-ml,"hi I'm from Indonesia. I didn't have any symptoms until last week I felt bloated in my stomach and it was followed by my stomach suddenly getting bigger like a pregnant woman. I immediately went to the doctor and an ultrasound revealed cysts on the right and left ovaries. It is said that cysts are liquid and solid. The cyst also produces fluid which makes my stomach enlarge. The doctor suctioned the fluid and produced 3 liters. Now we are still waiting for the results of the lab examination of the fluid.
 Yesterday's CA 125 test was 11,718 U/ml.
 What is the meaning of all friends? Has anyone experienced CA125 above 10,000?
 Please share to encourage me",hi im from indonesia i didnt have any symptoms until last week i felt bloated in my stomach and it was followed by my stomach suddenly getting bigger like a pregnant woman i immediately went to the doctor and an ultrasound revealed cysts on the right and left ovaries it is said that cysts are liquid and solid the cyst also produces fluid which makes my stomach enlarge the doctor suctioned the fluid and produced 3 liters now we are still waiting for the results of the lab examination of the fluid yesterdays ca 125 test was 11718 uml what is the meaning of all friends has anyone experienced ca125 above 10000 please share to encourage me,not mentioned,Yes,Moderate,"bloated stomach, stomach suddenly getting bigger, cysts on the right and left ovaries, fluid production making stomach enlarge","bloated stomach, stomach suddenly getting bigger"
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/327578/rare-reaction-to-taxol,"73 yo recenty diagnosed with peritoneal cancer. Was taking Ozempic and the side effects I was having I believe masked my cancer symptoms. Underwent 1st chemo with carbo and taxol on august 8. 2 days later had some trouble breathing. Went to the er and admitted on 16 liters of oxygen. Rare reaction to taxol. In hospital for 6 weeks trying to clear my lungs. I was finally sent home on 4-5 liters of O2. Started on carbo and doxcil and ca-125 increased by 90 points. Doc suspects I may be carbo resistant, although I did get covid in between infusions. Doc wants to do hysterectomy but I am not thrilled about undergoing general anesthesia with my compromised lungs. . Last 2 CT scans were stable but still on O2. Doc said this would be a good time for surgery. So this isn‚Äôt a typical decision on having a hysterectomy. I have a 10-13% chance of complications from mild to life support. These could happen to anyone without lung disease. Have not seen this issue being discussed. At 73 yo I‚Äôm trying to figure out why I would want to go thru this.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/325898/how-to-get-rid-of-the-worry-and-dread,"Hi. I'm new. I've been struggling with opening up since Nov 2020. I was hit with lung cancer nov 2020, had a lobotomy. Thought I was in the clear, then in March 2021, was hit with ovarian cancer. I went from stage 1 to stage 4 in three weeks. Doctors were blown away I had 9 rounds of chemo, then put on rubraca . My hair came back but not correctly. Eyebrow and eye lashes not the same. I'm thankful for what I have, but it's been a year since my last IV chemo and I wear a hat because my hairline is so far back. I wake up every day thanking God I am here. I just struggle with the fear of when and where the cancer will come back. My memory is awful now. I want to feel good about myself again. I had So much energy all of the time and it's just gone. Multiple surgeries and hospitalizations , I can't seem to catch a break. Losing my job and the income I had broke my heart.
 On a wonderful note, I have wonderful kids and grandchildren. Just have to be extra careful due to catching every germ that blows past .
 I just wish I could figure out how not to be angry pr sad. The medicine I'm on doesn't help that.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/193144/skin-problems-during-after-chemo,"Just wondering if anyone else had this experience and could offer some tips.
 
 Once chemo began and I lost my hair I discovered a few pimples along the hair line in the back of my neck. A couple of days later my entire head was full of pimples. Not only was I a bald woman, I was a pimply bald woman. grrrr !!!
 
 Anyway, once chemo ended my hair starting growing back in about 2 months and the pimples went away. The hair on my legs started to go as well and after my first shave, pimples appeared all over the front of my legs. I've gone to the dermatologist, and the gyn/onc has looked at it. The derm said it was folliculitis like the pimples on my head.
 
 He prescribed minocyline and a prescription strength cream like hydracordisone but 2 months later I can't get rid of it.
 
 I suspect my immune system is still out of whack from the chemo.
