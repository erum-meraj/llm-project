https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/327116/ovarian-cancer-overwhelmed,"hi, my wife is presumably to have ovarian cancer.
 big belly, bloating and loss of appetite started about one month ago.
 Went to primary doc, then did an Ultrasound about 3 weeks ago, it showed 3cm pancreatic tumor and ascites. Scheduled for a CT scan the following week. Then her bloating/cough got much worse so we checked into the ER about 3 days after ultrasound.
 In the ER, they did CT scan, biopsy, paracenthesis and bloodwork on 9/22. it showed she has two tumors about 10cm x 10 cm in pelvis area, one on each side. Her CA-125 is at 15085. Pancreas are normal. Still waiting for biopsy results.
 Had first consultation with an oncologist who has a clinic next to the ER hospital on 9/25. He suggested 3 rounds of chemo then surgical removal if biopsy result confirms it's ovarian cancer.
 We also went back to the ER on 9/28 to do a thoracenthesis to drain fluid from her left lung, waiting for appointment to do her right lung.
 She's having really bad constipation and severe bloating from anything she eats. She's already taking
 docusate (stool softener) 2. simethicone (antigas) 3. spironolactone (water pill)
 She's been eating very little, just one or two cups of chopped watermelon, a few spoonfuls of wheat noodle, that's about it.
 some questions so far:
 anything we can do about the bloating and what can she eat to avoid the severe bloating? she's cut out all diaries now, they seem to be the most troublesome
 what is the typical tumor size that's too big for surgery w/o shrinking it by chemo. We're hoping she can just go straight to surgery.
 We're in SoCal near Long Beach area. Is City of Hope a good place to get second opinion or cancer treatment? what about UCLA Irvine?
 Thanks in advance.",hi my wife is presumably to have ovarian cancer big belly bloating and loss of appetite started about one month ago went to primary doc then did an ultrasound about 3 weeks ago it showed 3cm pancreatic tumor and ascites scheduled for a ct scan the following week then her bloatingcough got much worse so we checked into the er about 3 days after ultrasound in the er they did ct scan biopsy paracenthesis and bloodwork on 922 it showed she has two tumors about 10cm x 10 cm in pelvis area one on each side her ca125 is at 15085 pancreas are normal still waiting for biopsy results had first consultation with an oncologist who has a clinic next to the er hospital on 925 he suggested 3 rounds of chemo then surgical removal if biopsy result confirms its ovarian cancer we also went back to the er on 928 to do a thoracenthesis to drain fluid from her left lung waiting for appointment to do her right lung shes having really bad constipation and severe bloating from anything she eats shes already taking docusate stool softener 2 simethicone antigas 3 spironolactone water pill shes been eating very little just one or two cups of chopped watermelon a few spoonfuls of wheat noodle thats about it some questions so far anything we can do about the bloating and what can she eat to avoid the severe bloating shes cut out all diaries now they seem to be the most troublesome what is the typical tumor size thats too big for surgery wo shrinking it by chemo were hoping she can just go straight to surgery were in socal near long beach area is city of hope a good place to get second opinion or cancer treatment what about ucla irvine thanks in advance,"docusate, simethicone, spironolactone",Yes,High,"big belly, bloating, loss of appetite, constipation, severe bloating","big belly, bloating, severe bloating"
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/257442/doxil-stomach-cramps-anyone,"There have been a few different conversations on here about doxil and side effects - most recently the rash which I do have. However my main problem now seems to be with severe stomach cramps. The kind where you curl up in a ball and hold your breath until the pain subsides. Ugh!
 I have had four rounds of Doxil. I first had the cramping after the third round. It was so bad over a weekend I nearly called my doctor and went to the emergency room. So we had a sonogram done to make sure I didn't have anything else going on - like gall stones. Gall stones!!??? I don't have time for gall stones! LOL! Anyway I do not have gall stones. 
 The pain starts about a week after my treatment and can last several days - really bad first day or two then subsides over time. Actual pain which comes and goes and lots of tenderness to the touch or when I move - like roll over in bed. Since I have had it the last two times I am guessing this is going to be pretty much standard opperating procedure for me and Doxil. 
 I have read one of the more rare side effects (less than 1%) is internal inflamation and sometimes internal blistering of the colon and bile duct tubing going from the gall bladder (or something like that). Well that sounds pretty much like whats going on. Woo hoo. I can't just have the normal run of the mill side effects like hand and feet blistering and mouth sores. Oh no I have to have some bizarre exotic reaction! 
 After the third treatment because of this and the skin rash was so bad we discussed decreasing the dose - but I opted for at least one more at full strength. If it keeps working and things don't get too much worse I figure I will put up with it for a while before switching to something else. 
 Anyone else experience this with doxil?",there have been a few different conversations on here about doxil and side effects most recently the rash which i do have however my main problem now seems to be with severe stomach cramps the kind where you curl up in a ball and hold your breath until the pain subsides ugh i have had four rounds of doxil i first had the cramping after the third round it was so bad over a weekend i nearly called my doctor and went to the emergency room so we had a sonogram done to make sure i didnt have anything else going on like gall stones gall stones i dont have time for gall stones lol anyway i do not have gall stones the pain starts about a week after my treatment and can last several days really bad first day or two then subsides over time actual pain which comes and goes and lots of tenderness to the touch or when i move like roll over in bed since i have had it the last two times i am guessing this is going to be pretty much standard opperating procedure for me and doxil i have read one of the more rare side effects less than 1 is internal inflamation and sometimes internal blistering of the colon and bile duct tubing going from the gall bladder or something like that well that sounds pretty much like whats going on woo hoo i cant just have the normal run of the mill side effects like hand and feet blistering and mouth sores oh no i have to have some bizarre exotic reaction after the third treatment because of this and the skin rash was so bad we discussed decreasing the dose but i opted for at least one more at full strength if it keeps working and things dont get too much worse i figure i will put up with it for a while before switching to something else anyone else experience this with doxil,Doxil,Yes,High,"rash, severe stomach cramps, internal inflammation, internal blistering of the colon, tenderness to the touch, hand and feet blistering, mouth sores","rash, mouth sores"

I immediately went to the doctor and an ultrasound revealed cysts on the right and left ovaries. It is said that cysts are liquid and solid. The cyst also produces fluid which makes my stomach enlarge. The doctor suctioned the fluid and produced 3 liters. Now we are still waiting for the results of the lab examination of the fluid.
 Yesterday's CA 125 test was 11,718 U/ml.

Multiple surgeries and hospitalizations , I can't seem to catch a break. Losing my job and the income I had broke my heart.
 On a wonderful note, I have wonderful kids and grandchildren. Just have to be extra careful due to catching every germ that blows past .

 Once chemo began and I lost my hair I discovered a few pimples along the hair line in the back of my neck. A couple of days later my entire head was full of pimples. Not only was I a bald woman, I was a pimply bald woman. grrrr !!!
 
 Anyway, once chemo ended my hair starting growing back in about 2 months and the pimples went away. The hair on my legs started to go as well and after my first shave, pimples appeared all over the front of my legs. I've gone to the dermatologist, and the gyn/onc has looked at it. The derm said it was folliculitis like the pimples on my head.
 
 He prescribed minocyline and a prescription strength cream like hydracordisone but 2 months later I can't get rid of it.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/327004/2-year-update,"Hello everyone. It‚Äôs been a long while since my last post. This is because (I‚Äôll cut to the chase) I had a recurrence on my 13th month after pronounced in remission. To recap, I had my first diagnosis of ovarian cancer stage IIA on 8/27/21. I had surgery and 6 rounds of chemo then was placed on Zejula. On my last blood work, CA-125 jumped to 40 from 19. It didn‚Äôt seem much but actually the little bit of spike was enough to say that the cancer was back.
 Needless to say, I had another surgery on 10/2/22 and another 6 rounds of chemo. Lost all of my hair, eyebrows, and lashes againüòä. I went through the same ordeal like the first time. This time after the chemo, no more anti neoplasm maintenance med so I had to do a quarterly pet scan/Ct Scan for monitoring. Just got done with the 2nd PET Scan and so far it‚Äôs good. Still working full time and might have missed only 2-3 work days. I‚Äôm resilient that way. I might have vomited once and very little nausea in 2 years. I sleep good and have enough energy for work. I‚Äôm a nurse practitioner and see 18 patients in a primary care clinic everyday.
 I learned a lot from this ordeal and would like to share some nuggets here and there hoping to encourage and alleviate unnecessary pitfalls for others who are new to this experience.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/325601/blood-draw-results,"To those who are new to the maintenance after chemo, here are some tips to watch out for that I have experienced:
 Subscribe to your lab website so you can monitor and compare your lab results from time to time and see how your trending, are the markers improving, needs close monitoring? Or heading towards a catastrophe? My RBC, hemoglobin 6.5, and platelets 10 got me to the ER full of sick/COVID people. Got 2 units of platelets and 2 units of red blood cells and missed work the following day. Was taking the zejula for 3 months before I became symptomatic with dizziness, constipation, insomnia, and very short of breath terribly.
 When you start talking zejula, start taking supplements, ferrous sulfate, vitamin B12, multi vitamin, and lots of salad and green juice (for your platelets) before your markers tank out. Protect your red blood cell components, in short, be proactive rather than reactive or you‚Äôll be sorry, I wish I knew this before taking Zejula, I could spared myself of the side effects (which are many to include here), complications and lots of lost sleep.
 Watch out for your liver enzymes particularly ALT, AST, Alkaline Phosphotase, and bilirubin, you don‚Äôt want to end up with another major problem: Drug induced cirrhosis of the liver. I have to take myself off zejula right now, my bilirubin is up 1.8 (extremely high) and no one, not my primary or oncologist have called me yet ü§™‚òπÔ∏è.
 This is a learning process, learning as you go. You are the best judge of your own health. You have to be super vigilant in constant research when you think and feel that something is wrong. Make your oncologist do something, run blood work, do CT Scan, prescribe something, and check you up, don‚Äôt settle for telehealth medicine, do a face to face visits.
 Go organic, eat healthy, exercise, and live life! Do something special with your family, love, and enjoy their company. No your not dying, but this new experience made me realize how important they are in my life, I‚Äôm so blessed to have everyone of them.
 Journalize everything so you can go back on your notes if something goes wrong what you did. Write down when you started taking whatever including what you eat, drink, BM, sleep, meds, treatment, blood work and results (what results were abnormal), symptoms, how you felt, and how your day turned out to be (outcomes).
 Pump your self up with positive thoughts, encouraging music (I surround myself with Christian music), talks ( I listen to Max Lucado-so encouraging, funny and full of life). It‚Äôs your job to stay encouraged. Do not go down the road of self pity, it‚Äôs natural to ask the ‚Äúwhy me Lord‚Äù, but don‚Äôt live there.
 Have a special time with your spouse, important for you and for your partner. Then have a ‚Äúme‚Äù time to reflect on everything. A quiet time to meditate, love yourself, and love on God for always being there to help you heal, be strong, and be a blessing and encouragement to others.
 No stress and no worrying, you got this!!! You have a strong, calm, and balance mind. You have a magnificent spirit, you have wisdom, and an iron will to succeed in anything your hand touches.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/315105/doxil-and-avastin-side-effects,"Hello everyone. I just joined the CSN and would like hearing about your experiences with these drugs and their side effects. I have recurrent uterine cancer that is being treated as ovarian. I had a hysterectomy in 2015 followed by chemo drugs. Diagnosed again in 2017 and had Carboplatin/then Cisplaten with Gemzar. The scans were inconclusive so I started a regimine of Doxil and Avastin in November. I just started treatment again after a 3 week postponement due to side effects, then a fever. 
 Now, of course as you know, living with the death sentence of ""terminal cancer"" is difficult. Very hard to plan. But the hardest part at this time is the burns on my body. My hands and feet swelled up red. My sides were red as if extremely sunburned. My toes are still peeling. My nurse recommended CeraVe. Nothing helped. Now I've seen my gp who offered a cream, and my dermatologist who prescribed another cream to help with the itching. I expect this to start again. My skin is at the itching stage now. Have any of you experienced this and if so, did you find relief somewhere? Thanks in advance.
 Another thread asked about CA125. Mine was not a factor in the past but in 2017 went up to 178. It is in the 30s now. I just want to survive this. I keep telling my doctors who didn't expect me to be around this long, I'm still here!

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/319291/symptoms-possibly-indicative-of-ovarian-cancer,"Hello all,
 I'm sorry I'm sure you get a lot of posts like this but I'm rather concerned.
 Since the beginning of March I have lost around 6kg (13lbs). I have progressively been getting other symptoms including:
 Early satiety
 A feeling of constant fullness and heaviness in my abdomen
 Constipation (which is alleviated with increased intake of vegetables) & flatulence even after having a bowel movement
 Bloating which comes and goes (probably related to the gas)
 Occasionally frequent urination which sometimes smells like protein
 Sharp lower left abdominal & pelvic pains
 Period which came a week early and lasted 2 weeks. A week later I got my period again which lasted for about a week and was much heavier than normal (bright red and lots of clots) 
 Leg cramps when I was going to sleep a few nights ago. I occasionally get pains in both my legs. The right foot is also painful sometimes and there is an area which is slightly swollen and appears bruised (I didn't injure myself).
 Knee pain and lower left back pain (mostly on exertion)
 I get short of breath at times but that might be due to the heavy feeling in my abdomen as well as my anxiety. 
 I was formally diagnosed with PCOS & IBS 2 years ago, I'm not sexually active (nor have I ever been), and have a history of breast cancer on my father's side of the family. I'm not currently taking any medications.
 My blood results all appear normal, except my HbA1c which was low. All inflammatory markers are normal. My CA-125 was also within the normal range, however I've read that it's not always reliable, particularly in the early stages.
 The gastroenterologist completely brushed me off saying that I'm too young (20 years old) to have ovarian cancer and said that my IBS is causing all these symptoms. But I've had IBS for a long time and I've never experienced these symptoms. Besides, IBS doesn't explain the weight loss or the abnormal bleeding, and the pain associated with my IBS is normally confined to my central abdomen. He has ordered a test to rule out IBD and I'm waiting for those results. 
 I had an ultrasound this morning - the radiologist said that everything is fine and that there is no fluid in my abdomen. However, the left ovary was obscured by gas and she couldn't see it properly. She also said that I didn't have enough urine (I drank almost a whole bottle beforehand).
 Could anybody who has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer please tell me whether this is something to be worried about? I know it's more common in women who are older than 50 years old but most of the symptoms I looked up coincide with ovarian cancer and I read that people who have a family history of breast cancer (besides ovarian) are at an increased risk.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/318698/seeking-advice-14cm-cyst-on-left-ovary,"Hi Ladies,
 I'm 46 and I found out last week I have a 14cm cyst on my left ovary. This was found through ultrasounds my doctor ordered due to my lower abdomen sticking out while lying down. One was pelvic and other transvaginal. Ob doctor gave me the CA125, did cervical biopsies, and biopsied a cervical polyp. She said the CA125 was okay, and biopsies benign. The ob is planning on getting the cyst out laproscopically. She said if they see a borderline cyst, everything will be removed.
 I need some advice and these are questions I have. What is borderline? I would like an MRI to see if it is benign or not before surgery. Is this a good idea and reasonable request? Should I request an oncology gynecologist to do the surgery? I have a regular ob doing it, and they say they won't get an oncology gynecologist unless during the surgery they see something and call one in last minute. I think this is backwards, why not have one doing it in the first place? What are some other good questions to ask and what would you do? I will also ask the doctor, but wanted to see what you ladies have to say as well.
 I told her I want to keep my ovaries. If I can't keep the one the cyst is on, I want to keep the other one. I would like to keep everything because I already have bladder issues due to this pushing down on my bladder, my mom has alzheimers and losing my ovaries will affect my mental capacity sooner (I already forget streets in my town), I already have low bone density due to taking depo provera in my twenties, and I don't want to lose my sex drive.
 Will I be able to request this even if suspicion of cancer? I'm thinking they think it's benign but can't really be sure until they go in and biopsy the actual cyst. This is why I would like an MRI before surgery.
 Thank you for any advice!
 Sincerely,

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/318357/sandidoglover-welcome-most-ladies-here-r-dx-w-some-type-of-oc-a-fewer-have-peritoneal-cancer-also,"Good morning Sandi ~
 You came on late last night, consequently I missed reading your post. I was watching the World Series baseball game. But I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt miss it altogether. I will say that the forum on which you wrote mainly dealt with Lynparza vs. chemo as written about by ‚ÄúVajraWoman8‚Äù. There were 16 replies mostly addressed to her. She first posted here in December of 2017, and last wrote here on April 17, 2018. She was curious about Lynparza. However, after her doctors prescribed it for her, she was taken off of it 2 months later. We haven‚Äôt heard from her lately. But if she writes again, I‚Äôm sure she will come back to this same topic forum and give us an update. So presently, we don‚Äôt know her latest status. She did not mention anything about Peritoneal Cancer in all her writings.
 I say all that to say this, since you specifically state that you are a Stage IV Ovarian cancer and Peritoneal cancer, this puts you in a different category than most here. As I continue to read on this forum, it seems that most here do not have Peritoneal involvement. So that makes you a bit unique in that you are wanting to hear from others who have progressed to this stage I believe. For that reason, I want to put your request on a ‚Äúnew topic forum‚Äù. If you will return here to the new post, we can better keep up with your own situation. So please read my reponse to you as you first wrote here:

 lynparza for last 8 mos, so far so good
  Oct 23, 2018 - 10:06 pm - sandidoglover
 i am not brca positive. i was stage four ovarian and pertonitel cancer victim. seeking a friend to share the experience with sandi‚Äù
 __________________________________________ 
 So Sandi, it seems that you and I seem to be ‚Äúin the same boat.‚Äù Without any previous inclination of problems, at age 73, I felt a small nodule below my waist line on the left side. This led me to believe that I might have a hernia. So after one weekend with some slight abdominal discomfort and groin pain, I went to the emergency room here in Virginia Beach. (November of 2012) they asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI think I have a hernia.‚Äù (I WISH!) Two hours later a CT scan revealed Peritoneal Carcinomatosis! Just 3 weeks later I had a second opinion which included a PET scan and exploratory surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). There it was revealed that ovaries were cancerous as well. So while there are many here with Ovarian cancer, not as many have metastasis to the Peritoneal space as well. 
 In December of 2012, UPMC recommended chemotherapy first (Carboplatin & Paclitaxel (Taxol), and then CYTOREDUCTIVE surgery (CRS) which is major surgery. So I came home and went through my first series of chemotherapy. It reduced enough of the cancer to qualify me for Cytoreductive Surgery. 
 Then on July 1, 2013, surgery took place at UPMC. After the first few days I questioned my ability to ‚Äúmake it through‚Äù. However, with God‚Äôs help, I‚Äôm still here today and will soon celebrate 6 years of life after what could have been death early on. No‚Äîit‚Äôs not been a piece of cake. With God‚Äôs help and total support of family and friends and a wonderful oncologist and supportive staff, so far the ‚Äústruggle‚Äù has been worth it. BUT I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say life is filled with ‚Äúhighs and lows‚Äù. I find keeping life in perspective, living and coping with our ‚Äúrearranged‚Äù life, not of our own making, and a strong personal faith in the Lord have sustained me through some dark days. 
 Now Sandi, since you did not elaborate on your ‚Äúabout me‚Äù page, I don‚Äôt know how far along you are at this Stage of life you are, but with peritoneal issues, this means that the cancer is in more than one place. I, too, am not BRCA positive, although there were 20 major cancers on my mom‚Äôs side of the family that included breast cancer. My own sister was diagnosed with breast cancer as well as were several of my cousins. So I‚Äôm a bit perplexed as to why my test was negative. Nevertheless, here we are. 
 Presently, I am in my 6th and last series of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel (Taxol) treatments. The last one before this only afforded me 10 weeks before my CA-125 began to escalate rapidly. So what my oncologist suggested proved to be true. (What would he know‚Äîha ha?) He felt that my body had built up a resistance to this combination and that I should switch to another drug. He suggested DOXIL and I said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. So now completion of this present treatment is intended to try to reduce the tumor marker level down one more time and then be switched to an oral drug ‚ÄúOLAPARIB‚Äù. Now I know that my body cannot sustain a constant chemo level indefinitely without debilitating effects, but as we say, ‚ÄúIT IS WHAT IT IS!‚Äù 
 Presently I have developed 3 blood clots in the last week although I was on the drug Coumadin. My ‚ÄúWarfarin‚Äù level ideally is to be between 2 and 3. However, in the last 3 weeks of testing, the numbers were 1.9‚Äî1.5‚Äî1.2. So for some unknown reason, the drug wasn‚Äôt being processed by my body. So I was given LOVINOX injections for 3 straight days plus greatly increasing my Coumadin dosage. Monday the count was back up to 1.9. I return tomorrow for another check to see what‚Äôs going on. 
 One theory was that because of my ongoing problem with diarrhea as a result of my surgery in which a substantial amount of my intestines were removed, that the drug may not have remained in my system long enough to take effect. I have lost a good amount of weight and diarrhea is a ‚Äúmonster.‚Äù But I find that since my surgery, the see-saw between Constipation and Diarrhea has been my biggest constant problem. On ‚ÄúD‚Äù days, it isn‚Äôt smart to wander far from home! But hey, I‚Äôm still happily alive and in my right mind. 
 So if you don‚Äôt hear from me quickly, it may mean that I am not doing well on that particular day. No matter how I feel, I try to keep a check on this site, as well as the Peritoneal and Esophageal forums because I‚Äôm not the only one having difficulties. Other‚Äôs experiences help us to better understand our own, and we try to help them with their problems.
 So for me, it‚Äôs never a matter of ‚Äúrecurrence‚Äù but when something new is going to ‚Äúoccur‚Äù. Now if I concentrate on the future possibilities I find that leads to wasted time I could be enjoying what I still am blessed to have in the here and now. So it is a constant battle to keep my thoughts on what‚Äôs happening in the moment and to keep my ‚Äúmind‚Äù on today‚Äôs problem. 
 Many of my sisters here express a strong abiding faith in the Lord and naturally credit Him with their ability to cope. But regardless of how we best cope‚Äîcope we must. But this truth goes for all of us who are in this ‚Äúday-to-day/moment-by-moment‚Äù struggle to stay positive and stay strong. And on that note I would like to share something that the theologian Oswald Chambers wrote years ago on the subject of living in the moment. He writes:
  ‚ÄúGod does not give us overcoming life. 
  He gives us life as we overcome.
  The strain is the strength.
  If there is no strain, there is no strength.
  God never gives strength for tomorrow,
  or for the next hour, but only for the strain of the minute!‚Äù 
 Borrowing trouble from tomorrow is a constant temptation but only ends in futility. Yes‚Äîit‚Äôs easier said than done‚Äîliving in the moment. Often that advice is given to us by those who seemingly are enjoying the good life and have few problems‚Äîcertainly not a Stage IV cancer. But we will be forever miserable if we find we are ‚Äúfixed‚Äù on the future, of which none of us can be sure, instead of enjoying what God has given us today. There are blessings and God has to continually remind me that He hasn‚Äôt forgotten me.
 And just like many others here have stated, I know that my capacity for compassion and appreciation for life have been greatly expanded due to cancer. Cancer has its own circle of friends. I think of so many of my friends who died of cancer in my lifetime. But not until I entered that exclusive circle myself, first as a caregiver to my husband and his Esophageal Cancer some 16 years ago and now my own Stage IV cancer, did I know what it feels like to be diagnosed with cancer. To say it is a ‚Äúlife changer‚Äù is an understatement. Now what we do with that diagnosis will determine how we ‚Äúmake it.‚Äù No‚ÄîI‚Äôm not wishing I had cancer much earlier in life‚ÄîI‚Äôm just saying now I can say, ‚ÄúI know just how you feel‚Äù and really mean it. And because of that I see now how inadequate I was to actually comfort my many friends who died before me. So Sandi, since we seem to have much in common, if there is anything I can help you with, I‚Äôll do my best. Someone has summed it up so beautifully.
  ‚ÄúHe cannot heal who has not suffered much,
  For only sorrow‚Äîsorrow understands.
  He will not come for healing at our touch,
  Who have not seen the scars upon our hands.‚Äù
 So Sandi, you will find many friends here who have ‚Äúscars upon their hands‚Äù and suffered much 
 and will gladly help you as well.
 Love Loretta

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/316878/doctors-are-brushing-me-off,"Anyone else have doctors brush you off for months? I'm not diagnosed quite yet, but also have the signs and swollen lymph nodes in groin and neck. As of lately, my lower back and hip are sore to touch, so now I'm extra worried that help is too late at this point since my bones hurt.
 It started as back pain after stopping my birth control. I brushed it off for weeks until finally caving and making an appointment. At the same time I got the urge to urinate A LOT. Tested for UTI, came back clean, so dx was interstitial cystitis. NSAIDS worked for back but urge to pee stayed and lymph nodes popped up.
  Given amoxicillin for a virus I didn't have. Then loose stools started and constant burping. Begged for answers and got referred to a GI. Colonoscopy and endoscopy came back normal so dx was GERD and IBS.
  Getting worse on meds so went back to GP. Told me IBS, and lymph nodes are just there, then asked me about my anxiety.
  Switched GP who ordered a stool culture: dx - c diff! So angry I went back to my first gp to tell him. He then said he'd refer me to a specialist at a clinic four hours away. Still waiting on that appointment. I asked for a CA 125 test and he said no. 
  Expressed my concerns of ovarian cancer to new GP and she said tests all normal so she wasn't worried.
  I've had CT scans only showing a cyst that went away, and trace free fluid in pelvis. Chest X rays for pain in my chest came back normal, cbc have only showed slightly elevated bilirubin and neutrophils. 
  I took it upon myself to pay for a CA 125 (9) and CEA (1.2) myself, both showing normal range. I know these tests aren't always elevated so I was relieved for like a day and then worried I'm just one of those people who doesn't have an elevated CA 125.
  Sorry for the long post.. just wondering if anyone here has had all normal tests with symptoms and got diagnosed later? I clearly have lymph nodes that are hard, palpable, and on CT but no one will biopsy? My doctor's even felt them and said they're enlarged and hard. I'm not sure how to push any further. My OB says endo, and scheduled me for a laprascopic but she's on vacation and it's not for another few weeks, which is too long for me considering I'm getting worse and have lost 14 lbs since April now.
  Symptoms:
 Lower back pain
 Swollen lymph nodes in groin and neck
 Indigestion
 Burping
 Loose stools
 Stomach cramps

 I hope it's ok to post here. Although I haven't been diagnosed, my mother has. We have just found out this week so this is relatively new for all of us. I am an only child so I will be one of the main caregivers for my mom and supports as she goes through this process.
 She just tured 64 last month. For the past year or so she has been having health issues shes tried to get to the bottom of. Weakness, fatigue, stomach pain and upset. She's been to doctors off and on before she finally got one that did a ct scan a couple of weeks ago. That's when she finally figured out there was a major problem.
 They found a spot on her greater omentum that they were concerned about and wanted to biopsy. It came back as cancer of an unknown origin. So we knew the cancer had already spread we just weren't sure from where. After waiting almost a week she finally got the pathology report and all signs pointed to ovarian cancer. They did blood work and her CEA GI blood work was negative but her CA125 level was 608.
 She has an appointment with a gynecological oncologist early next week, but couldn't get in for a PET scan until the following week. So as of now, we don't know know much more. How far it has spread, if its in lymph nodesa and or/other organs, stage, etc. What we do know is that it had traveled to her omentum at least (although ct scan didn't really show any other spots of concern, nothing even showing in or around ovaries. They did say her appendix and gall bladder looked a little odd, but not that they saw anything they thought were cancerous). 
 I am naturally worried sick but hoping for the best. Also trying to stay calm as I'm six months pregnant with her 4th granddaughter (one reason i won't be able to go with her to her PET scan). I'm just looking for any similar stories, advice, etc. I have read several threads on here and already gained valuable insight. Just thought maybe I could ask directly. Thank you in advance for any replies.",hi everyone i hope its ok to post here although i havent been diagnosed my mother has we have just found out this week so this is relatively new for all of us i am an only child so i will be one of the main caregivers for my mom and supports as she goes through this process she just tured 64 last month for the past year or so she has been having health issues shes tried to get to the bottom of weakness fatigue stomach pain and upset shes been to doctors off and on before she finally got one that did a ct scan a couple of weeks ago thats when she finally figured out there was a major problem they found a spot on her greater omentum that they were concerned about and wanted to biopsy it came back as cancer of an unknown origin so we knew the cancer had already spread we just werent sure from where after waiting almost a week she finally got the pathology report and all signs pointed to ovarian cancer they did blood work and her cea gi blood work was negative but her ca125 level was 608 she has an appointment with a gynecological oncologist early next week but couldnt get in for a pet scan until the following week so as of now we dont know know much more how far it has spread if its in lymph nodesa and orother organs stage etc what we do know is that it had traveled to her omentum at least although ct scan didnt really show any other spots of concern nothing even showing in or around ovaries they did say her appendix and gall bladder looked a little odd but not that they saw anything they thought were cancerous i am naturally worried sick but hoping for the best also trying to stay calm as im six months pregnant with her 4th granddaughter one reason i wont be able to go with her to her pet scan im just looking for any similar stories advice etc i have read several threads on here and already gained valuable insight just thought maybe i could ask directly thank you in advance for any replies,not mentioned,Yes,High,"Weakness, fatigue, stomach pain, upset",none

 Teflon frying pan on wooden table
 
 
  The chemicals once seemed near magical, able to repel water, oil and stains.
 By the 1970s, DuPont and 3M had used them to develop Teflon and Scotchgard, and they slipped into an array of everyday products, from gum wrappers to sofas to frying pans to carpets. Known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, they were a boon to the military, too, which used them in foam that snuffed out explosive oil and fuel fires.
  It‚Äôs long been known that, in certain concentrations, the compounds could be dangerous if they got into water or if people breathed dust or ate food that contained them. Tests showed they accumulated in the blood of chemical factory workers and residents living nearby, and studies linked some of the chemicals to cancers and birth defects.
 Now two new analyses of drinking water data and the science used to analyze it make clear the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense have downplayed the public threat posed by these chemicals. Far more people have likely been exposed to dangerous levels of them than has previously been reported because contamination from them is more widespread than has ever been officially acknowledged.
 Moreover, ProPublica has found, the government‚Äôs understatement of the threat appears to be no accident.
 The EPA and the Department of Defense calibrated water tests to exclude some harmful levels of contamination and only register especially high concentrations of chemicals, according to the vice president of one testing company. Several prominent scientists told ProPublica the DOD chose to use tests that would identify only a handful of chemicals rather than more advanced tests that the agencies‚Äô own scientists had helped develop which could potentially identify the presence of hundreds of additional compounds.
 The first analysis, contained in an EPA contractor‚Äôs PowerPoint presentation, shows that one chemical ‚Äî the PFAS most understood to cause harm ‚Äî is 24 times more prevalent in public drinking water than the EPA has reported. Based on this, the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization whose scientists have studied PFAS pollution, has estimated that as many as 110 million Americans are now at risk of being exposed to PFAS chemicals.
 In the second analysis, ProPublica compared how the military checks for and measures PFAS-related contamination to what‚Äôs identified by more advanced tests. We found that the military relied on tests which are not capable of detecting all the PFAS chemicals it believed to be present. Even then, it underreported its results, sharing only a small part if its data. We also found that the military‚Äôs own research programs had retested several of those defense sites using more advanced testing technology and identified significantly more pollution than what the military reported to Congress.
 Even before the troubling new information about PFAS chemicals emerged, the government had acknowledged problems relating to them were spreading. Past EPA water testing, however incomplete, identified drinking water contamination across 33 states that Harvard researchers estimated affected some 6 million people. The military suspected drinking water at more than 660 U.S. defense sites where firefighting foam was used could be contaminated; earlier this year, it announced it had confirmed contamination in 36 drinking water systems and in 90 groundwater sites on or near its facilities.
 The new analyses suggest these findings likely represent just a fraction of the true number of people and drinking water systems affected.
 In written responses to questions, the EPA did not directly address whether it had understated contamination from PFAS chemicals. The agency said it had confidence in its current testing procedures and had set detection limits at appropriate levels. It also stated that it is taking steps towards regulating some PFAS compounds and registering them as ‚Äúhazardous substances,‚Äù a classification that triggers additional oversight under waste and pollution laws.
 The agency will ‚Äútake concrete actions to ensure PFAS is thoroughly addressed and all Americans have access to clean and safe drinking water,‚Äù then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who recently resigned, said in the written statement to ProPublica in May.
 The Department of Defense also responded to questions in writing, defending its testing methods as the best available and calling it difficult to fully assess risks from PFAS because the EPA has not regulated these chemicals. A DOD spokeswoman said the Pentagon‚Äôs research group has a program underway aimed at enhancing the test methods and detecting more PFAS compounds, but suggested that no alternatives were ready for use. She did not answer questions about why the agency reported contamination levels for only two chemicals to Congress when it would have had data on many more, stating only that the Pentagon ‚Äúis committed to protecting human health and the environment.‚Äù
 Environmental experts aren‚Äôt convinced.
 ‚ÄúWidespread contamination may be harming the health of millions or even tens of millions of Americans and the government is intentionally covering up some of the evidence,‚Äù said Erik Olson, a senior director for health, food and agriculture initiatives at the Natural Resources Defense Council, in an interview. The EPA and Defense Department ‚Äúhave done all they can to sort of drag their feet and avoid meaningful regulatory action in making significant investment in cleanups.‚Äù
 In May, a Politico report revealed that the EPA and the White House, along with the Defense Department, had pressured a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to withhold a health study expected to warn that people exposed to PFAS chemicals face greater health risks than were previously understood. That report was quietly released in mid-June and, indeed, estimated safe levels of exposure are seven to 10 times smaller than what the EPA has said.
 Such a determination could spur stricter limits on exposure than the EPA appears to have considered. Paired with an emerging realization that testing by the EPA and DOD hasn‚Äôt captured the true extent of contamination, the government could be forced to reconceive its approach to these compounds, said David Sedlak, the director of the Institute for Environmental Science and Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped develop one of the most advanced commercial tests for PFAS substances.
 ‚ÄúNot talking about it isn‚Äôt going to make the problem go away,‚Äù Sedlak said. ‚ÄúAnd because these compounds are forever ‚Äî they aren‚Äôt going to degrade on their own ‚Äî eventually there is going to be a day of reckoning.‚Äù
 The PFAS compounds might not exist if weren‚Äôt for a lab accident in 1938, when a frozen block of refrigerant turned into an extraordinarily slippery white, waxy mass. A decade later DuPont was manufacturing it as Teflon. 3M developed its own version, the molecularly similar PFOA in 1954, when a chemist inadvertently spilled a mixture of chemicals on her shoe and found the stain was impervious to soap or water. They called it Scotchgard.
 These products work, in part, because the chemicals they contain are made up of some of the strongest and most resilient molecular bonds in existence, thanks to a unique structure that keeps them from breaking down. There are thousands of variations, all characterized by extremely strong daisy chains of carbon and fluorine molecules and differentiated mostly by the length of their ‚Äútails‚Äù ‚Äî the string of carbon molecules that can be anywhere from two to 14 units long.
 In the mid-1970s, with the use of the chemicals proliferating, Dupont and 3M began privately testing the blood of their plant workers and others. The companies had grown increasingly concerned about the toxicity of PFAS compounds, learning that they ‚Äúbio-accumulate‚Äù in food and people and that they could cause harm. But it wasn‚Äôt until 2000, when 3M pulled Scotchgard from the market, that the EPA began to investigate PFAS‚Äôs potential damage to human health and the environment, and soon after, that the blood tests became public.
 At first, the EPA took steps that suggested it would quickly get to the bottom of the problem. Citing the spread of contaminants in water supplies in Minnesota and Ohio, in 2002 the agency launched a ‚Äúpriority review‚Äù of some PFAS compounds. It wrote then that exposure can ‚Äúresult in a variety of effects including developmental/reproductive toxicity, liver toxicity and cancer.‚Äù
 By 2003, the EPA launched its first draft risk assessment for PFOA, typically a substantial step towards establishing strict regulatory standards that limit a chemical‚Äôs use and mandate its cleanup. When the draft was released in early 2005, it said that while the epidemiological evidence remained inconclusive, rats tested with PFOA were more likely to develop liver and pancreatic cancers, and there were worrisome signs that workers in plants that manufactured PFOA had a higher risk of dying of prostate cancer.
 The EPA also asked industries to voluntarily phase out PFOA-related products, including the firefighting foam, by 2015.
 The question was then ‚Äî and remains today ‚Äî how much exposure to PFAS chemicals would make people seriously ill?
 In 2009, the agency attempted an answer, issuing ‚Äúprovisional‚Äù voluntary guidelines for safe levels of the chemicals in drinking water. This meant that for the first time, the government offered a precise, scientific measure for how much of the compounds was too much. But it didn‚Äôt mandate those limits, or create a regulation enforceable by law. And even those limits ‚Äî it would later become clear ‚Äî proved too loose.
 Meanwhile, other instances of water contamination ‚Äî in Minnesota and Alabama ‚Äî heightened concerns. One study of 60,000 residents in West Virginia and Ohio exposed to high levels of PFOS and PFOA from a DuPont manufacturing plant and an Army airfield showed they had high rates of thyroid malfunction, testicular and kidney cancers and preeclampsia. The study was completed as part of a roughly $107 million settlement of a lawsuit against DuPont. Studies on animals also linked the chemicals to structural birth defects and dramatic changes in hormone levels.
 In 2013, with concern rising over the ubiquity of PFAS compounds, the EPA decided it would test for some of the chemicals in public drinking water systems. The agency regulates chemicals under the Safe Drinking Water Act and adds new substances to the list based on tests showing they‚Äôre widespread enough to pose a national threat. Listing a chemical for such testing is often a step toward creating enforceable regulations for it.
 At the same time, the agency began to reconsider the health advisory limit it had established in 2009. In 2016, the agency announced a dramatically lower limit for how much PFAS exposure was safe for people, suggesting a threshold less than one-eighth the amount it had once assured would cause no harm. Under the new guidelines, no more than 70 parts per trillion of the chemicals, less than the size of a single drop in an Olympic pool, were deemed safe.
 Yet even this standard remains voluntary and unenforceable. Until there‚Äôs a true limit on the concentration of PFAS compounds allowable in drinking water, soil and groundwater ‚Äî and the classification of PFAS as a hazardous substance ‚Äî the EPA can‚Äôt hold water utilities, companies or other polluters to account. It also can‚Äôt compel the Department of Defense to adhere to the standard or clean up contamination.
 There is increasing evidence that PFAS contamination is more widespread on and around military bases than previously thought.
 The Department of Defense launched a full-scale review of contamination in drinking water systems at its facilities in 2016, despite the lack of clear regulatory limits from the EPA.
 This spring the Pentagon reported to Congress that 564 of the 2,445 off-base public and private drinking water systems that it had tested contained PFOS or PFOA above the EPA‚Äôs advisory limits. It also announced that groundwater at 90 out of 410 military bases where it tested contained dangerous levels of these two chemicals. A staggering 61 percent of groundwater wells tested exceeded the EPA‚Äôs threshold for safety, according to the presentation Maureen Sullivan, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment, safety and occupational health, gave to Congress in March. Attending to the problem, several news outlets have reported, would cost the Pentagon at least $2 billion.
 In presenting its liabilities to Congress, the Defense Department took an important step in wrestling with a troublesome issue, much as the EPA had in undertaking national data collection.
 But both agencies have quite deliberately chosen not to use the most advanced tools or to collect the most comprehensive data on contamination, researchers say.
 To identify PFAS compounds in drinking water, the EPA uses a lab test called ‚ÄúMethod 537,‚Äù which separates microscopic molecules so they can be more easily seen. It‚Äôs not the most sophisticated test available, but scientists have used it enough to give them ‚Äî and regulators ‚Äî extraordinary confidence in its results. This is the test the EPA chose in 2013, when it directed its labs across the country to test water samples to evaluate emerging PFAS chemical contaminants to help determine whether they should be regulated.
 But even though the Method 537 test can detect 14 PFAS compounds, the EPA only asked for data on six of them. The EPA said this was to allow for testing of non-PFAS pollutants, since the agency is only allowed to target a certain number of emerging contaminants in each round of tests.
 The agency also set detection thresholds for the six PFAS compounds included as much as 16 times higher than what the test was sensitive enough to detect ‚Äî so high that only the most extreme cases of contamination were reflected in the federal drinking water dataset.
 Indeed, according to a recent presentation by Andrew Eaton, vice president of Eurofins Eaton Analytical, the largest drinking water test lab in the country, which handled testing of more than 10,000 samples from 1,100 public water systems ‚Äî about 30 percent of the EPA‚Äôs water samples overall ‚Äî vast amounts of detected contamination was ignored by design.
 Through its federal water quality reporting, the EPA has said publicly that PFOA was detected in just 1 percent of water samples across the nation. But when Eaton recently went back and reanalyzed the data the EPA didn‚Äôt want, he found PFOA was in nearly 24 percent of the samples his company tested.
 Another chemical, PFBS, is considered a sentinel because in situations where it is a component of contamination also containing PFAS and PFOA, it travels further and faster in water and shows up months or years ahead in places where PFOA or PFOS are ultimately detected. The EPA has reported that PFBS was found in less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all its water samples ‚Äî not even one in 100. Eaton‚Äôs re-analysis detected the sentinel chemical in nearly one out of eight of samples.
 ‚ÄúIt basically says the plume is on its way, that‚Äôs the leading indicator‚Ä¶ PFOS and PFOA is likely on the way to your house,‚Äù said Jennifer Field, a professor of environmental and molecular toxicology at Oregon State University. Field is a leading expert on test methods for PFAS compounds. The Department of Defense helps fund her research. ‚ÄúIf you are on the hydrological flow path it‚Äôs a matter of time and distance.‚Äù
 The EPA defended its detection limits, saying its testing protocol is designed to yield consistent, reliable results even if labs conducting the tests are less sophisticated.
 But the government is far from certain that lower levels of PFAS compounds than those that count as contamination by the EPA‚Äôs definition aren‚Äôt health threats. The EPA has repeatedly lowered how much exposure to PFAS compounds it considers acceptable. And when the CDC finally released its health analysis for PFAS compounds in June, it called for limits of one compound to be 10 times lower than the EPA‚Äôs current threshold, and another to be seven times lower. Such a standard would be more in line with some states, which already have tougher limits in place. New Jersey, for example, has set its exposure limit for PFOA at roughly one-fifth of what the EPA prescribes.
 The EPA‚Äôs testing protocol ‚Äî which only certifies the 537 test, with its limitations ‚Äî also hasn‚Äôt kept up with fast-evolving science around PFAS chemicals. Researchers have identified new forms of the chemicals and, potentially, new dangers from these variants.
 In 2016, Field and several other researchers ‚Äî as part of a Defense Department research program examining water samples from 15 defense sites where firefighting foam was used (researchers declined to name them) ‚Äî identified 40 new families of PFAS chemicals, consisting of some 240 compounds they‚Äôd never seen before.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre starting to get this idea that more complex chemistry was used at these sites than was picked up in the tests, and that‚Äôs kind of the punchline,‚Äù said Field, of the firefighting foam sites in particular. ‚ÄúThere is more mass down there, there are more species and in higher concentrations than what you see.‚Äù
 Method 537, as a rule, is not capable of detecting these additional compounds. Yet when the Pentagon launched its own water testing program at U.S. bases in 2016, it chose to use the EPA‚Äôs outdated testing process, even though a test capable of detecting the presence of dozens of additional PFAS compounds was available. That test, called the Top Assay, was even developed with Defense Department support.
 Instead, the Defense Department relied exclusively on the 537 test and then, when it reported its findings to Congress this past March, it offered only the results for PFOS and PFOA and not the other 12 compounds the test process identifies, because that‚Äôs what Congress had asked for. Indeed, according to one memorandum from the Department of the Navy, the armed services were explicitly instructed to withhold their extra data ‚Äî at least for the time being ‚Äî because it was ‚Äúnot being used to make decisions.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIf you were going to spend $200 million testing DoD sites across the country, wouldn‚Äôt you want to test for all of the chemicals you know you used?‚Äù asked Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics, who has been active on chemical cleanup issues at Defense sites.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like a deliberate thing, where you‚Äôre going to tell people their water is safe to drink, and you know that you have a gap in your testing and you know that you haven‚Äôt found all of the chemicals in the water.‚Äù
 Scientists are only now beginning to understand the importance of the information the government is choosing to leave out. Field has found, for example, not only that there are more variations of PFAS compounds, but that some degrade over time into PFOS or PFOA, or, like PFBS, travel faster in the environment, making them predictors for other contaminants soon to come.
 Many of the variants with shorter ‚Äútails‚Äù ‚Äî or shorter chains of molecules than the test methods can detect ‚Äî ‚Äúare likely to break through systems designed to capture‚Äù them, Field and others wrote in a 2017 paper published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. They are also more likely to elude the water treatment methods the EPA and the Department of Defense are using to clean water identified as contaminated.
 The consequence of these systemic blind spots is that ‚Äúby the time you see PFOS and PFOA you may have been drinking other things for a longer period of time,‚Äù Field said.
 When Field retested water samples at several U.S. defense sites using the most advanced testing available, she found that many of these obscure additional chemicals were nearly uniformly present ‚Äî and in huge numbers. At one site, for example, where PFOS was detected at 78,000 parts per trillion, another obscure PFAS compound was present at nearly three times that concentration.
 Based on Eaton‚Äôs higher-resolution detection rates, scientists at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that researches the dangers of PFAS compounds, have generated new estimates of contamination linked to the chemicals.
 They now think more than 110 million people have been exposed to the compounds through their drinking water, more than five times as many as the group had previously estimated.
 The EPA ‚Äúhas really underplayed the extent of contamination,‚Äù said David Andrews, a senior scientist at EWG. ‚ÄúThe scope of the problem seems to be expanding.‚Äù",toxins contribute to cancer how

of water contamination in minnesota and alabama heightened concerns one study of 60000 residents in west virginia and ohio exposed to high levels of pfos and pfoa from a dupont manufacturing plant and an army airfield showed they had high rates of thyroid malfunction testicular and kidney cancers and preeclampsia the study was completed as part of a roughly 107 million settlement of a lawsuit against dupont studies on animals also linked the chemicals to structural birth defects and dramatic changes in hormone levels in 2013 with concern rising over the ubiquity of pfas compounds the epa decided it would test for some of the chemicals in public drinking water systems the agency regulates chemicals under the safe drinking water act and adds new substances to the list based on tests showing theyre widespread enough to pose a national threat listing a chemical for such testing is often a step toward creating enforceable regulations for it at the same time the agency began to reconsider the health advisory limit it had established in 2009 in 2016 the agency announced a dramatically lower limit for how much pfas exposure was safe for people suggesting a threshold less than oneeighth the amount it had once assured would cause no harm under the new guidelines no more than 70 parts per trillion of the chemicals less than the size of a single drop in an olympic pool were deemed safe yet even this standard remains voluntary and unenforceable until theres a true limit on the concentration of pfas compounds allowable in drinking water soil and groundwater and the classification of pfas as a hazardous substance the epa cant hold water utilities companies or other polluters to account it also cant compel the department of defense to adhere to the standard or clean up contamination there is increasing evidence that pfas contamination is more widespread on and around military bases than previously thought the department of defense launched a fullscale review of contamination in drinking water systems at its facilities in 2016 despite the lack of clear regulatory limits from the epa this spring the pentagon reported to congress that 564 of the 2445 offbase public and private drinking water systems that it had tested contained pfos or pfoa above the epas advisory limits it also announced that groundwater at 90 out of 410 military bases where it tested contained dangerous levels of these two chemicals a staggering 61 percent of groundwater wells tested exceeded the epas threshold for safety according to the presentation maureen sullivan the deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment safety and occupational health gave to congress in march attending to the problem several news outlets have reported would cost the pentagon at least 2 billion in presenting its liabilities to congress the defense department took an important step in wrestling with a troublesome issue much as the epa had in undertaking national data collection but both agencies have quite deliberately chosen not to use the most advanced tools or to collect the most comprehensive data on contamination researchers say to identify pfas compounds in drinking water the epa uses a lab test called method 537 which separates microscopic molecules so they can be more easily seen its not the most sophisticated test available but scientists have used it enough to give them and regulators extraordinary confidence in its results this is the test the epa chose in 2013 when it directed its labs across the country to test water samples to evaluate emerging pfas chemical contaminants to help determine whether they should be regulated but even though the method 537 test can detect 14 pfas compounds the epa only asked for data on six of them the epa said this was to allow for testing of nonpfas pollutants since the agency is only allowed to target a certain number of emerging contaminants in each round of tests the agency also set detection thresholds for the six pfas compounds included as much as 16 times higher than what the test was sensitive enough to detect so high that only the most extreme cases of contamination were reflected in the federal drinking water dataset indeed according to a recent presentation by andrew eaton vice president of eurofins eaton analytical the largest drinking water test lab in the country which handled testing of more than 10000 samples from 1100 public water systems about 30 percent of the epas water samples overall vast amounts of detected contamination was ignored by design through its federal water quality reporting the epa has said publicly that pfoa was detected in just 1 percent of water samples across the nation but when eaton recently went back and reanalyzed the data the epa didnt want he found pfoa was in nearly 24 percent of the samples his company tested another chemical pfbs is considered a sentinel because in situations where it is a component of contamination also containing pfas and pfoa it travels further and faster in water and shows up months or years ahead in places where pfoa or pfos are ultimately detected the epa has reported that pfbs was found in less than onetenth of 1 percent of all its water samples not even one in 100 eatons reanalysis detected the sentinel chemical in nearly one out of eight of samples it basically says the plume is on its way thats the leading indicator pfos and pfoa is likely on the way to your house said jennifer field a professor of environmental and molecular toxicology at oregon state university field is a leading expert on test methods for pfas compounds the department of defense helps fund her research if you are on the hydrological flow path its a matter of time and distance the epa defended its detection limits saying its testing protocol is designed to yield consistent reliable results even if labs conducting the tests are less sophisticated but the government is far from certain that lower levels of pfas compounds than those that count as contamination by the epas definition arent health threats the epa has repeatedly lowered how much exposure to pfas compounds it considers acceptable and when the cdc finally released its health analysis for pfas compounds in june it called for limits of one compound to be 10 times lower than the epas current threshold and another to be seven times lower such a standard would be more in line with some states which already have tougher limits in place new jersey for example has set its exposure limit for pfoa at roughly onefifth of what the epa prescribes the epas testing protocol which only certifies the 537 test with its limitations also hasnt kept up with fastevolving science around pfas chemicals researchers have identified new forms of the chemicals and potentially new dangers from these variants in 2016 field and several other researchers as part of a defense department research program examining water samples from 15 defense sites where firefighting foam was used researchers declined to name them identified 40 new families of pfas chemicals consisting of some 240 compounds theyd never seen before youre starting to get this idea that more complex chemistry was used at these sites than was picked up in the tests and thats kind of the punchline said field of the firefighting foam sites in particular there is more mass down there there are more species and in higher concentrations than what you see method 537 as a rule is not capable of detecting these additional compounds yet when the pentagon launched its own water testing program at us bases in 2016 it chose to use the epas outdated testing process even though a test capable of detecting the presence of dozens of additional pfas compounds was available that test called the top assay was even developed with defense department support instead the defense department relied exclusively on the 537 test and then when it reported its findings to congress this past march it offered only the results for pfos and pfoa and not the other 12 compounds the test process identifies because thats what congress had asked for indeed according to one memorandum from the department of the navy the armed services were explicitly instructed to withhold their extra data at least for the time being because it was not being used to make decisions if you were going to spend 200 million testing dod sites across the country wouldnt you want to test for all of the chemicals you know you used asked jane williams executive director of california communities against toxics who has been active on chemical cleanup issues at defense sites its almost like a deliberate thing where youre going to tell people their water is safe to drink and you know that you have a gap in your testing and you know that you havent found all of the chemicals in the water scientists are only now beginning to understand the importance of the information the government is choosing to leave out field has found for example not only that there are more variations of pfas compounds but that some degrade over time into pfos or pfoa or like pfbs travel faster in the environment making them predictors for other contaminants soon to come many of the variants with shorter tails or shorter chains of molecules than the test methods can detect are likely to break through systems designed to capture them field and others wrote in a 2017 paper published in the journal environmental science and technology they are also more likely to elude the water treatment methods the epa and the department of defense are using to clean water identified as contaminated the consequence of these systemic blind spots is that by the time you see pfos and pfoa you may have been drinking other things for a longer period of time field said when field retested water samples at several us defense sites using the most advanced testing available she found that many of these obscure additional chemicals were nearly uniformly present and in huge numbers at one site for example where pfos was detected at 78000 parts per trillion another obscure pfas compound was present at nearly three times that concentration based on eatons higherresolution detection rates scientists at the environmental working group an advocacy organization that researches the dangers of pfas compounds have generated new estimates of contamination linked to the chemicals they now think more than 110 million people have been exposed to the compounds through their drinking water more than five times as many as the group had previously estimated the epa has really underplayed the extent of contamination said david andrews a senior scientist at ewg the scope of the problem seems to be expanding,not

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/315339/suepr-info-re-iv-vs-ip-chemo-treatments-related-info-4-ovarian-cancer-w-multiple-references,"Good afternoon ~ May I call you Sue?
 As for your question about IP vs IV, you will probably get a more current answer if you will start your OWN topic forum on this same link, for this reason. You have put your query on a link that first began in 2011. That was 7 years ago. Now the only one that is posting currently on different topics is ‚ÄúTethys41.‚Äù She is a survivor of Stage III OC for a long time and her tests show NED presently. That‚Äôs always the best news. So I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to start a new topic forum for you specifically. If you will come back ‚Äúhere‚Äù for additional comments and questions, you will hear from the women who currently post here. So here is your posting this morning. My comments follow your post.

 ‚ÄúSuepr - IP Chemo - Mar 10, 2018 - 7:39 am -
 I have just been diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer and have started IP chemo. I am new to this chat stuff and this website. What does NED stand for? I had my first treatment 1 week ago and was in the hospital overnight due to the slow IV infusion of Taxol. I am getting Cisplatin but that was pretty quick. I will IP Taxol on day 8. I am curious if it is easier than the IP cisplatin or not. It is good to hear all the comments.‚Äù
 ______________________________________________________ 
 So Sue ‚Äì here are my personal comments in answer to your posting this morning.
 NED stands for ‚ÄúNo evidence of Disease‚Äù. (The first reference #1 below will give you a list of cancer terms and acronyms. You will find NED listed in the ‚ÄúN‚Äù section naturally. I‚Äôm forever seeing abbreviations that I don‚Äôt understand. The first time I saw the letters ‚ÄúNED‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt know what it meant either. 
 As for me, I‚Äôve been a survivor for 5 years now. I started out diagnosed as a Stage IV cancer, Peritoneal Carcinomatosis. It was first discovered in the peritoneal fluid in my abdomen. A second opinion, exploratory surgery and a PET/CT scan at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, (UPMC) revealed it to be also in my ovaries. So we never bothered to figure out which came first. At that point, it didn‚Äôt matter, it was Stage IV!
 I had pre-op (neoadjuvant) chemo, then Cytoreductive Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center July 1, 2013. I then had targeted radiation (Cyberknife) that successfully eliminated 3 cancerous nodes on the Caudate Lobe of my Liver. Then in subsequent years, 2015, 2016, and 2017 I have had 6-regimen treatments of the same drug. As for me, I am currently undergoing IV treatments of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel (Taxol) once more. Each time seems to give me about 10 months at most of ‚Äúsymptom free‚Äù or ‚ÄúProgression free survival‚Äù commonly referenced as ‚ÄúPFS‚Äù but never ‚ÄúNo Evidence of Disease (NED). So far the quality of life I enjoy has been ‚Äúworth‚Äù the side effects of the 6-regimen chemo treatments given 3 weeks apart. 
 But like I said, many women are on this site and will be glad to share their experiences with you. I have included some references below my name that are directly related to your question of IP or IV. They are technical in nature, and much is there that I don‚Äôt attempt to decipher, but I can usually read the ‚Äúabstract‚Äù and the ‚Äúconclusions reached‚Äù and that tells me all I need to know about that particular study or clinical trial. 
 There is often an IP infusion that comes at the end of a Cytoreductive surgery for those women who qualify for that particular surgery known as HIPEC. I note that when women are first diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer that sometimes pre-op (neoadjuvant) chemo is ordered then a surgery follows. At other times, surgery comes first, and then post-op (adjuvant) chemo. However, as I scan the articles written below, it seems that women who have the intravenous infusions experience less toxicity.
 I have read articles below that say that the IP infusions are more difficult to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù the required number of cycles than those who have the standard ‚ÄúIV‚Äù infusions. At this point, this is probably information ‚Äúoverload‚Äù unless you have a background in medical speak, which I do not. But I‚Äôve been able to learn all I think I need to understand concerning my own cancer. 
 The word neoadjuvant means ‚Äúbefore‚Äù, and the word ‚Äúadjuvant‚Äù means ‚Äúafter‚Äù when referencing sequence of events. So in my case, I had ‚Äúneoadjuvant‚Äù chemo, then the surgery. Moreover what is removed during surgery will depend on each individual and their own particular diagnosis. 
 So here‚Äôs hoping that you‚Äôll be a quick learner, and find out all you can about your own Ovarian Cancer Stage and what treatments are best recommended. For most of us, or at least speaking for myself, I knew nothing about Ovarian cancer except how to spell it. But when it has your name attached, then it gets ‚Äúpersonal.‚Äù 
 Love Loretta
 Peritoneal Carcinomatosis/Ovarian Cancer Stage IV first diagnosed in 2012 and still blessed to be here.

 Introduction
 This section aims to provide a reference list of abbreviations and acronyms that are frequently used within oncology.
 As well as many widely used medical abbreviations this text includes abbreviations that have meaning only within oncology, sub-specialties or even particular organisations. No definitive list of standard abbreviations exists therefore it is important to understand the context in which they have been used in.
 For example ""PNET"" usually refers to a type of brain tumour, however, within orthopedic oncology the same abbreviation has been applied to a form of sarcoma. You may also find it useful to have access to a medical dictionary or text-book that contains a list of common abbreviations used within the wider field of medicine.
 This list of has been compiled over a number of years and abbreviations have been collected from a wide range of sources including journal articles and conference presentations.
 Acknowledgements Thanks to the following who have contributed additional abbreviations to this list; Jane Evans, Kevin Fishwick, Anna Mitchell, Moira Stewart and the staff of the former UKCCSG Data Centre.

 ‚Äú‚Ä¶Because epithelial ovarian cancers begin deep in the pelvis, they often do not cause any symptoms until they are at an advanced stage. Furthermore, many of the symptoms of ovarian cancer are hard to differentiate from symptoms experienced by women who do not have ovarian cancer, such as back pain, fatigue, abdominal bloating, constipation, vague abdominal pain, and urinary symptoms. Because of the lack of specificity of early ovarian cancer symptoms, [2] the majority of women (roughly 70%) already have advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis.[3] Ovarian cancer is often originally suspected in women when their physician finds an abnormal pelvic growth during an internal pelvic examination. Ovarian cancer may spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity and lead to the buildup of fluid inside the abdomen, called ascites. Ovarian cancer may cause symptoms such as swelling of the abdomen, pain, irregular bowel movements or difficulty breathing when fluid places pressure on the lungs‚Ä¶‚Äù

 ‚ÄúChemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer
 Chemotherapy (chemo) is the use of drugs to treat cancer. Most often, chemo is a systemic treatment ‚àí the drugs are given in a way that lets them enter the bloodstream and reach all areas of the body. Systemic chemo can be useful for cancers that have metastasized (spread). Most of the time, systemic chemo uses drugs that are injected into a vein (IV) or given by mouth. For some cases of ovarian cancer, chemotherapy may also be injected through a catheter (thin tube) directly into the abdominal cavity. This is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Drugs given this way are also absorbed into the bloodstream, so IP chemotherapy is also a type of systemic chemo. This is discussed in more detail later in this section.
 Chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer
 Chemo for ovarian cancer is most often a combination of 2 or more drugs, given IV every 3- to 4-weeks. Giving combinations of drugs rather than just one drug alone seems to be more effective in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer.
 The standard approach is the combination of a platinum compound, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, and a taxane, such as paclitaxel (Taxol¬Æ) or docetaxel (Taxotere¬Æ). For IV chemotherapy, most doctors favor carboplatin over cisplatin because it has fewer side effects and is just as effective.
 The typical course of chemo for epithelial ovarian cancer involves 3 to 6 cycles. A cycle is a schedule of regular doses of a drug, followed by a rest period. Different drugs have varying cycles; your doctor will let you know what schedule planned for your chemo.
 Epithelial ovarian cancer often shrinks or even seems to go away with chemo, but the cancer cells may eventually begin to grow again. If the first chemo seemed to work well and the cancer stayed away for a long time (at least 6 to 12 months), it can be treated with additional cycles of the same chemotherapy used the first time. In some cases, different drugs may be used‚Ä¶
 Intraperitoneal chemotherapy
 In intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, in addition to giving the chemo drug paclitaxel IV, the drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel are injected into the abdominal cavity through a catheter (thin tube).
 The tube can be placed during the staging/debulking surgery, but sometimes it is placed later. If it is done later, it can be placed by a surgeon using laparoscopy, or by an interventional radiologist under x-ray guidance. The catheter is usually connected to a port, a half dollar-sized disk topped with a pliable diaphragm. The port is placed under the skin against a bony structure of the abdominal wall, such as a rib or pelvic bone. A needle can be placed through the skin and into the port to give chemo and other drugs. Over time, problems may rarely occur with the catheter. ‚àí It may become plugged or infected or even damage the bowel.
 Giving chemo this way gives the most concentrated dose of the drugs to the cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. This chemo also gets absorbed into the bloodstream and so can reach cancer cells outside the abdominal cavity. IP chemotherapy works well, but the side effects are often more severe than with regular chemo. In a study of women with advanced ovarian cancer, women getting the IP chemotherapy had more abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and other side effects than the women getting chemo through the vein. These side effects actually made some women stop their treatment early. Still, the women getting IP chemotherapy lived longer than the women getting regular chemo.
 IP chemotherapy currently is only given to some of the women with ovarian cancer that has spread to the inside of the abdomen. It was only studied in women whose cancer had not spread outside the abdomen (stage III) and who had no tumors larger than 1 cm after surgery (optimally debulked).
 Also, because it can be so toxic, women must have normal kidney function and be in good overall shape for their doctor to be willing to try IP chemo.
 They also cannot have a lot of adhesions or scar tissue inside their abdomen because this can prevent the chemo from spreading well‚Ä¶‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSHOULD INTRAPERITONEAL CHEMOTHERAPY BE CONSIDERED AS STANDARD FIRST-LINE TREATMENT IN ADVANCED STAGE OVARIAN CANCER?...
 Abstract Current standard therapy for patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer is cytoreductive surgery followed by combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has demonstrated improved outcome compared to standard intravenous treatment in three large randomized phase III trials and confirmed by Cochrane meta-analysis.
 Although compelling evidence suggests that IP therapy provides survival benefit in a selected group of ovarian cancer patients, it remains unclear which group of patients will really benefit from IP therapy, which is the optimal drug, dose and combination, and what is the real benefit of IP treatment alone.
 Other concerns about IP therapy are difficulties in completing the assigned treatment and management of its pattern of toxic side-effects.
 Today, IP chemotherapy has yet to gain a role as standard first-line treatment in advanced stage ovarian cancer. In the near future, efforts should aim at developing an effective IP regimen and research undertaken for a better understanding of the peritoneal environment. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

 In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), intraperitoneal (IP) administration of chemotherapy is an effective first-line treatment and may improve outcomes, compared with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy.
 We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to compare long-term survival between propensity score-matched patients with advanced EOC receiving IP (n = 34) vs. IV (n = 68) chemotherapy.
 Additionally, clinical features associated with carboplatin-based (n = 21) and cisplatin-based (n = 16) IP chemotherapy were analyzed and compared with those associated with IV chemotherapy. The IP and IV chemotherapy groups had a median follow-up duration of 67 (range, 3‚Äì131) and 62 (range, 0‚Äì126) months, respectively, with no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.735) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.776).
 A significantly higher proportion of patients in the IV (91.2%) than in the IP (67.6%) chemotherapy group (P = 0.004) received ‚â• 6 cycles.
 However, the frequency of toxic events (anemia, granulocytopenia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatotoxicity, neuromuscular effects) was significantly higher in the IP than in the IV group.
 Within the IP group, no significant differences were observed in PFS (P = 0.533) and OS (P = 0.210) between the cisplatin-based and carboplatin-based chemotherapy subgroups.
 The 10-year OS was 28.6% and 49.2% in carboplatin-based and cisplatin based IP chemotherapy groups, respectively.
 Toxic events (granulocytopenia, leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, hepatotoxicity, neuromuscular effects) were significantly more common in the cisplatin-based subgroup.
 In patients with EOC, cisplatin-based IP chemotherapy may be an acceptable alternative to IV chemotherapy regarding long-term survival, but toxicity must be addressed‚Ä¶‚Äù
 __________________End of references_________________",good afternoon may i call you sue as for your question about ip vs iv you will probably get a more current answer if you will start your own topic forum on this same link for this reason you have put your query on a link that first began in 2011 that was 7 years ago now the only one that is posting currently on different topics is tethys41 she is a survivor of stage iii oc for a long time and her tests show ned presently thats always the best news so ive taken it upon myself to start a new topic forum for you specifically if you will come back here for additional comments and questions you will hear from the women who currently post here so here is your posting this morning my comments follow your post _________________________________________________ suepr ip chemo mar 10 2018 739 am i have just been diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer and have started ip chemo i am new to this chat stuff and this website what does ned stand for i had my first treatment 1 week ago and was in the hospital overnight due to the slow iv infusion of taxol i am getting cisplatin but that was pretty quick i will ip taxol on day 8 i am curious if it is easier than the ip cisplatin or not it is good to hear all the comments ______________________________________________________ so sue here are my personal comments in answer to your posting this morning ned stands for no evidence of disease the first reference 1 below will give you a list of cancer terms and acronyms you will find ned listed in the n section naturally im forever seeing abbreviations that i dont understand the first time i saw the letters ned i didnt know what it meant either as for me ive been a survivor for 5 years now i started out diagnosed as a stage iv cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis it was first discovered in the peritoneal fluid in my abdomen a second opinion exploratory surgery and a petct scan at the university of pittsburgh medical center upmc revealed it to be also in my ovaries so we never bothered to figure out which came first at that point it didnt matter it was stage iv i had preop neoadjuvant chemo then cytoreductive surgery at the university of pittsburgh medical center july 1 2013 i then had targeted radiation cyberknife that successfully eliminated 3 cancerous nodes on the caudate lobe of my liver then in subsequent years 2015 2016 and 2017 i have had 6regimen treatments of the same drug as for me i am currently undergoing iv treatments of carboplatinpaclitaxel taxol once more each time seems to give me about 10 months at most of symptom free or progression free survival commonly referenced as pfs but never no evidence of disease ned so far the quality of life i enjoy has been worth the side effects of the 6regimen chemo treatments given 3 weeks apart but like i said many women are on this site and will be glad to share their experiences with you i have included some references below my name that are directly related to your question of ip or iv they are technical in nature and much is there that i dont attempt to decipher but i can usually read the abstract and the conclusions reached and that tells me all i need to know about that particular study or clinical trial there is often an ip infusion that comes at the end of a cytoreductive surgery for those women who qualify for that particular surgery known as hipec i note that when women are first diagnosed with ovarian cancer that sometimes preop neoadjuvant chemo is ordered then a surgery follows at other times surgery comes first and then postop adjuvant chemo however as i scan the articles written below it seems that women who have the intravenous infusions experience less toxicity i have read articles below that say that the ip infusions are more difficult to complete the required number of cycles than those who have the standard iv infusions at this point this is probably information overload unless you have a background in medical speak which i do not but ive been able to learn all i think i need to understand concerning my own cancer the word neoadjuvant means before and the word adjuvant means after when referencing sequence of events so in my case i had neoadjuvant chemo then the surgery moreover what is removed during surgery will depend on each individual and their own particular diagnosis so heres hoping that youll be a quick learner and find out all you can about your own ovarian cancer stage and what treatments are best recommended for most of us or at least speaking for myself i knew nothing about ovarian cancer except how to spell it but when it has your name attached then it gets personal love loretta peritoneal carcinomatosisovarian cancer stage iv

chemotherapy for ovarian cancer chemotherapy chemo is the use of drugs to treat cancer most often chemo is a systemic treatment the drugs are given in a way that lets them enter the bloodstream and reach all areas of the body systemic chemo can be useful for cancers that have metastasized spread most of the time systemic chemo uses drugs that are injected into a vein iv or given by mouth for some cases of ovarian cancer chemotherapy may also be injected through a catheter thin tube directly into the abdominal cavity this is called intraperitoneal ip chemotherapy drugs given this way are also absorbed into the bloodstream so ip chemotherapy is also a type of systemic chemo this is discussed in more detail later in this section chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer chemo for ovarian cancer is most often a combination of 2 or more drugs given iv every 3 to 4weeks giving combinations of drugs rather than just one drug alone seems to be more effective in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer the standard approach is the combination of a platinum compound such as cisplatin or carboplatin and a taxane such as paclitaxel taxol or docetaxel taxotere for iv chemotherapy most doctors favor carboplatin over cisplatin because it has fewer side effects and is just as effective the typical course of chemo for epithelial ovarian cancer involves 3 to 6 cycles a cycle is a schedule of regular doses of a drug followed by a rest period different drugs have varying cycles your doctor will let you know what schedule planned for your chemo epithelial ovarian cancer often shrinks or even seems to go away with chemo but the cancer cells may eventually begin to grow again if the first chemo seemed to work well and the cancer stayed away for a long time at least 6 to 12 months it can be treated with additional cycles of the same chemotherapy used the first time in some cases different drugs may be used intraperitoneal chemotherapy in intraperitoneal ip chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in addition to giving the chemo drug paclitaxel iv the drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel are injected into the abdominal cavity through a catheter thin tube the tube can be placed during the stagingdebulking surgery but sometimes it is placed later if it is done later it can be placed by a surgeon using laparoscopy or by an interventional radiologist under xray guidance the catheter is usually connected to a port a half dollarsized disk topped with a pliable diaphragm the port is placed under the skin against a bony structure of the abdominal wall such as a rib or pelvic bone a needle can be placed through the skin and into the port to give chemo and other drugs over time problems may rarely occur with the catheter it may become plugged or infected or even damage the bowel giving chemo this way gives the most concentrated dose of the drugs to the cancer cells in the abdominal cavity this chemo also gets absorbed into the bloodstream and so can reach cancer cells outside the abdominal cavity ip chemotherapy works well but the side effects are often more severe than with regular chemo in a study of women with advanced ovarian cancer women getting the ip chemotherapy had more abdominal pain nausea vomiting and other side effects than the women getting chemo through the vein these side effects actually made some women stop their treatment early still the women getting ip chemotherapy lived longer than the women getting regular chemo ip chemotherapy currently is only given to some of the women with ovarian cancer that has spread to the inside of the abdomen it was only studied in women whose cancer had not spread outside the abdomen stage iii and who had no tumors larger than 1 cm after surgery optimally debulked also because it can be so toxic women must have normal kidney function and be in good overall shape for their doctor to be willing to try ip chemo they also cannot have a lot of adhesions or scar tissue inside their abdomen because this can prevent the chemo from spreading well ______________________________________________ 10 should intraperitoneal chemotherapy be considered as standard firstline treatment in advanced stage ovarian cancer abstract current standard therapy for patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer is cytoreductive surgery followed by combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin intraperitoneal ip chemotherapy has demonstrated improved outcome compared to standard intravenous treatment in three large randomized phase iii trials and confirmed by cochrane metaanalysis although compelling evidence suggests that ip therapy provides survival benefit in a selected group of ovarian cancer patients it remains unclear which group of patients will really benefit from ip therapy which is the optimal drug dose and combination and what is the real benefit of ip treatment alone other concerns about ip therapy are difficulties in completing the assigned treatment and management of its pattern of toxic sideeffects today ip chemotherapy has yet to gain a role as standard firstline treatment in advanced stage ovarian cancer in the near future

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/314734/testing-just-started,Hello everyone. I have been suffering over the past year-and-a-half. I have a family history of ovarian cancer. On my mom's side out of five girls all but my mom and one aunt has passed away from uterine or ovarian cancer. The aunt that didn't pass away from a female cancer passed away from lung cancer. I am 42 years old. I have been having problems with nausea and vomiting pain in my lower and upper abdomen irregular periods prolonged periods and all of the other symptoms that go along with ovarian cancer. I just had a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis which revealed a 4.2 cm Mass on my right ovary. The only testing I have had done for these problems is a AFP tumor marker test and the CT scan. They have also tested me for menopause which my hormones were normal. But I have been diagnosed with menopause and irritable bowel syndrome. My question is how do you get a doctor to treat you like you're not losing your mind. And what tests should be done? Since late last night the pain in my lower abdomen has become intense and is throbbing. I was awake most of the night. I have an appointment with my obgyn tomorrow. I just stopped taking the HRT because my menstrual cycle lasted 3 weeks and then I was off for 3 days and then back on for another 4 days until I stop the medication. I really just need to know what tests he should be doing? This has been a nightmare. I live in a very small town in the middle of nowhere. I can't seem to get a second opinion because all of the other doctors are not taking new patients. Unless that new patient has very good insurance. I haven't been able to work because of being sick what feels like all of the time. I'm sorry for going on and on I'm just extremely frustrated and worried. Nothing I have tried has helped with my symptoms. I am hoping he will do more tests. But I don't really have much faith in him at this point.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/314661/a-little-lost,"Hello.
 I have read this board and everyone seems very informed. I am looking for a few honest pointers. I am not the best at explaining myself so I will try to be quick and clear.
 I am trying to decide if looking into OC is a logical step for me. I havent Felt well for several months.
 I experience upset stomach and constipation daily (always changing between these two never normal) general abdoman discomfort 
 I have lost about 10lbs without trying in a month and half. I also feel as if I have a lump in my throat at all times and belch.
 My period became very heavy about two years ago, I also experience clots and tissues.
 inalso leak urin almost daily. I tried pelvic floor pt but it didn‚Äôt do much.
  I made and appointment with my doc. Because I thought I had a silent acid reflux And I couldn‚Äôt stand the lump in my throat.
 At my appointment my doc prescribed me acid reflux meds. She wants me to try it for two weeks and see if the neck fullness goes away. It isn‚Äôt working, 
 My doc also mentioned I fit the bill for IBS, OC and Thyroid cancer.....I had an ultra sound on my neck. There found two cyst and enlarged lymph nodes. None of it is cancer, if they get larger we will remove them. But these cyst do not explain most of my problems.
  Which has left us trying to decide whats next. I do not want to go on a witch hunt.
 My doc said I fit a lot of the warnings for OV but I am 36 and had a CT about 5 months ago for intense abdominal pain, which makes ov unlikely. The CT showed irregular shapes cystic lesions about 27 mm they said it was likely a collapsing corpus Luteum. I feel they would have been to see OC 5 months ago.
 If you were in my shoes would you look into OC or move onto intestinal and cycle issues.
  Thank you for any direction you can offer.",hello i have read this board and everyone seems very informed i am looking for a few honest pointers i am not the best at explaining myself so i will try to be quick and clear i am trying to decide if looking into oc is a logical step for me i havent felt well for several months i experience upset stomach and constipation daily always changing between these two never normal general abdoman discomfort i have lost about 10lbs without trying in a month and half i also feel as if i have a lump in my throat at all times and belch my period became very heavy about two years ago i also experience clots and tissues inalso leak urin almost daily i tried pelvic floor pt but it didnt do much i made and appointment with my doc because i thought i had a silent acid reflux and i couldnt stand the lump in my throat at my appointment my doc prescribed me acid reflux meds she wants me to try it for two weeks and see if the neck fullness goes away it isnt working my doc also mentioned i fit the bill for ibs oc and thyroid canceri had an ultra sound on my neck there found two cyst and enlarged lymph nodes none of it is cancer if they get larger we will remove them but these cyst do not explain most of my problems which has left us trying to decide whats next i do not want to go on a witch hunt my doc said i fit a lot of the warnings for ov but i am 36 and had a ct about 5 months ago for intense abdominal pain which makes ov unlikely the ct showed irregular shapes cystic lesions about 27 mm they said it was likely a collapsing corpus luteum i feel they would have been to see oc 5 months ago if you were in my shoes would you look into oc or move onto intestinal and cycle issues thank you for any direction you can offer,not mentioned,Yes,High,"upset stomach, constipation, general abdominal discomfort, lost about 10lbs without trying, lump in throat, belching, heavy periods, clots, tissues, leaking urine, neck fullness, enlarged lymph nodes",none
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/314601/stage-3c-solely-based-on-lymph-nodes,"So, I guess it started in March 2016. At age 50, my Mom started having awful periods, very painful and heavier than ever before. I work in OBGYN, so I thought this was just peri-menopausal symptoms, as did my provider. So an ultrasound was done, everything is normal besides her uterus is slightly long and her left ovary has multiple follicles. She is considering an ablation but the doctor does not think she is a good candidate because of the size of her uterus. So she decides to hold out to see if the awful periods just stop their own. They Don‚Äôt. Come October 2016, periods are worse than before, she wants something done. They decide to go with an IUD, so that is inserted the same day. Everything is awesome for a year. Periods are nonexistent, cramping has stopped, she loves the IUD.
  Come 06/2017, she starts having pain and swelling in her right ankle. PCP thinks it‚Äôs Gout. Gives her medicine for that which does nothing. She calls her back and says she is no better. I asked for her to get an doppler of her leg to check for DVT. Her PCP is not convinced. PCP says let‚Äôs order an X-ray to check for injury (there was no injury) I talk to Dr. S who is worried and says its no issue to order one, so she did. Low and Behold she has a DVT. Mom gets put on Xaralto for 3 months, the clot resolves fairly quickly.
  Fast Forward to October 19th, 2017, Im leaving for work and she's complaining of lower abdominal pain. First thing I think of is something is wrong with the IUD, So I asked her to come in ASAP for an ultrasound to make sure it‚Äôs still in the right place. So we get her in, ultrasound first then seeing the doctor. Ultrasound shows normal left ovary BUT cannot see right ovary because of large complex mass measuring at least 15cm, with blood flow. So now I‚Äô, worried, but she has a cruise scheduled the very next day to Mexico. So Doctor S. says go ahead and go, we will take care of everything when you get back. At first Doctor S. thinks its just a large complex cyst (Benign), but since it is so large it needs to come out. Doctor S. said since her periods are bad already, let‚Äôs do a hysterectomy with right oophorectomy. But with the cyst being so large, she will have to make a large vertical incision.
  So mom gets back from her trip, following day Doctor S. wants some blood work in anticipation for surgery. Also, mom was complaining of pain in her left leg now after the long car ride from Mexico. So another doppler was ordered. She ended up having 2 DVT‚Äôs in that leg. She was kept in the hospital to have an IVC filter, which prevents DVT‚Äôs traveling to the lungs. (She ended up already having multiple Pulmonary Embolisms at the time that wasn't known.) She Orders a CBC, CMP, and CA 125. Everything came back fine EXCEPT CA 125 was 2939, which is supposed to be 35 and below. Dr. S still doesn‚Äôt seem too worried, she thinks it is a Low malignant potential tumor. So she consults with one of her best oncology colleagues, which is Dr. Murray. Dr. Murray seems actually very worried, with the size of the mass, her very high CA 125, and with recurrent DVT‚Äôs. Now Dr. Murray is doing the surgery instead of Dr. S.
  We meet with Dr. Murray, she tells us straight up she thinks this is Ovarian Cancer. So now we have to wait a little over one month for surgery because Dr. Murray is worried about the blood clots. Come December 1st, surgery lasts for about 4-5 hours. She did a Hysterectomy w/BSO, appendectomy and omenectomy. Took multiple biopsies from everywhere, and ended up taking 15 lymph nodes. We are told it is cancer, but that it looks to be stage 1C. The tumor was not really adhered to anything at all, there was fluid from part of the tumor rupturing.
  About 1 week later we have her first post op, where she tells us she is now stage 3C. There is cancer in 2 lower lymph nodes and well as 1 along the aorta. Literally EVERYTHING else is negative for cancer. Uterus, left ovary, appendix, pelvic washings, all biopsies. I‚Äôve never heard of a story like this, I‚Äôve always seen stage 3C where there are tumors everywhere in the abdomen. We were expecting good ( considering) news and then it‚Äôs just awful. She will start chemo tomorrow, January 11th. Chemo will be 6 cycles of Carboplatin and Taxotere. I know she is in good hands with her Gynecologic Oncology doctor but I am absolutely terrified. I just want to hear stories, any helpful advice.",so i guess it started in march 2016 at age 50 my mom started having awful periods very painful and heavier than ever before i work in obgyn so i thought this was just perimenopausal symptoms as did my provider so an ultrasound was done everything is normal besides her uterus is slightly long and her left ovary has multiple follicles she is considering an ablation but the doctor does not think she is a good candidate because of the size of her uterus so she decides to hold out to see if the awful periods just stop their own they dont come october 2016 periods are worse than before she wants something done they decide to go with an iud so that is inserted the same day everything is awesome for a year periods are nonexistent cramping has stopped she loves the iud come 062017 she starts having pain and swelling in her right ankle pcp thinks its gout gives her medicine for that which does nothing she calls her back and says she is no better i asked for her to get an doppler of her leg to check for dvt her pcp is not convinced pcp says lets order an xray to check for injury there was no injury i talk to dr s who is worried and says its no issue to order one so she did low and behold she has a dvt mom gets put on xaralto for 3 months the clot resolves fairly quickly fast forward to october 19th 2017 im leaving for work and shes complaining of lower abdominal pain first thing i think of is something is wrong with the iud so i asked her to come in asap for an ultrasound to make sure its still in the right place so we get her in ultrasound first then seeing the doctor ultrasound shows normal left ovary but cannot see right ovary because of large complex mass measuring at least 15cm with blood flow so now i worried but she has a cruise scheduled the very next day to mexico so doctor s says go ahead and go we will take care of everything when you get back at first doctor s thinks its just a large complex cyst benign but since it is so large it needs to come out doctor s said since her periods are bad already lets do a hysterectomy with right oophorectomy but with the cyst being so large she will have to make a large vertical incision so mom gets back from her trip following day doctor s wants some blood work in anticipation for surgery also mom was complaining of pain in her left leg now after the long car ride from mexico so another doppler was ordered she ended up having 2 dvts in that leg she was kept in the hospital to have an ivc filter which prevents dvts traveling to the lungs she ended up already having multiple pulmonary embolisms at the time that wasnt known she orders a cbc cmp and ca 125 everything came back fine except ca 125 was 2939 which is supposed to be 35 and below dr s still doesnt seem too worried she thinks it is a low malignant potential tumor so she consults with one of her best oncology colleagues which is dr murray dr murray seems actually very worried with the size of the mass her very high ca 125 and with recurrent dvts now dr murray is doing the surgery instead of dr s we meet with dr murray she tells us straight up she thinks this is ovarian cancer so now we have to wait a little over one month for surgery because dr murray is worried about the blood clots come december 1st surgery lasts for about 45 hours she did a hysterectomy wbso appendectomy and omenectomy took multiple biopsies from everywhere and ended up taking 15 lymph nodes we are told it is cancer but that it looks to be stage 1c the tumor was not really adhered to anything at all there was fluid from part of the tumor rupturing about 1 week later we have her first post op where she tells us she is now stage 3c there is cancer in 2 lower lymph nodes and well as 1 along the aorta literally everything else is negative for cancer uterus left ovary appendix pelvic washings all biopsies ive never heard of a story like this ive always seen stage 3c where there are tumors everywhere in the abdomen we were expecting good considering news and then its just awful she will start chemo tomorrow january 11th chemo will be 6 cycles of carboplatin and taxotere i know she is in good hands with her gynecologic oncology doctor but i am absolutely terrified i just want to hear stories any helpful advice,"Xaralto, Carboplatin, Taxotere",Yes,High,"pain and swelling in her right ankle, DVT, pain in her left leg, multiple Pulmonary Embolisms, cancer, stage 3C, chemotherapy side effects",pain and swelling in her right ankle

 ________________________________________________________________ 
 Dear ‚ÄúLes‚Äù
 You‚Äôve got enough symptoms to be worried. However, I haven‚Äôt a clue as to what to tell you at this point, but I did look up a bit about Ovarian cysts, since I a terminal Ovarian Cancer patient, Stage IV. I‚Äôm not quite sure what you mean about having ‚Äútwo‚Äù primaries. Usually one is the primary cancer, and if it has spread to another organ, it will be designated as the primary with metastasis to the organ to which it has spread. In my case, it wasn‚Äôt determined which was the primary because at my initial testing, it was already Stage IV. My second opinion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center was found to be Ovarian Cancer Stage IV. However, the first place the tumors were discovered were in the Peritoneal Cavity by means of a CT scan. There were vast numbers of tumors floating around in the Peritoneal fluid in my abdominal cavity. So since both the initial diagnosis, Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in November of 2012, and my second opinion in December of 2012 for cancerous ovaries as well, are both treated in the same fashion, we didn‚Äôt waste time trying to figure out, ‚Äúwhich came first the chicken or the egg???‚Äù So I‚Äôm thinking that if this should turn out to be cancerous, isn‚Äôt it a good possibility that the diagnosis would be Breast cancer with metastasis to the ovaries, or whatever organ, if determined that it is cancer. 
 Now we‚Äôll just be honest, and say that for most of us, our minds jump to conclusions and write our obituary. But I‚Äôm still here 5 years later, although I have run out of options, and this is my last series of treatments that I am willing to take. Although my oncologist said he thinks that most likely I have developed an immunity to the Carboplatin/Paclitaxel (Taxol) combo, I told him, ‚ÄúThis is all I‚Äôm willing to take. I‚Äôm a Christian and know where I‚Äôm going when I die, and if it‚Äôs my time, it‚Äôs my time. I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice my quality of life and head on a downward spiral just to keep breathing.‚Äù He understood completely, and did not argue with me. 
 So as of today, wee hours of the morning on Thursday, January 18, 2018, I am scheduled for my second of 3 treatments to see how things are going. Then we‚Äôll go from there. My treatments are to be 3 weeks apart, and later today, 9:20 A.M. as a matter of fact, I‚Äôm supposed to be there ‚Äúbright-eyed and bushy tailed‚Äù! Now I won‚Äôt be ‚Äúbushy tailed‚Äù because I just shaved off my hair tonight. Taxol takes a toll on the body and with almost one fell swoop takes away the hair. Mine began to fall out 10 days later. Shaving my own head tonight was not accompanied with any emotion. It‚Äôs ‚Äúold hat‚Äù now. But the first was more traumatic. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs neither Hair nor There‚Äù I said. I feel much better knowing I‚Äôm not going to wake up with hair all over the pillow. After all, hair does not a woman make‚Ä¶but we feel more like one with some hair. Anyway, it‚Äôs no ‚Äúbiggie‚Äù at this point. My main concern will be that hopefully it will give me some more quality time. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, going through chemo and surgery isn‚Äôt what I classify as ‚Äúquality time‚Äù, but what it takes to be able to take the long look and envision a better life once we can recover.
 Now I did note that my CA-125 dropped 40 points after the first treatment, down from 185 to 145, so that‚Äôs encouraging. But like I say, ‚ÄúIt is what it is, and if it works I‚Äôll be delighted and so will my family.‚Äù However, I‚Äôve told them all ‚Äúthis is my last chemo treatment because I‚Äôm not going ‚Äúdown the ladder of ‚Äútools‚Äù in the doc‚Äôs box. After all, ‚Äútry this‚Äîtry that‚Äîtakes a toll on us‚Äù to be sure. And I‚Äôve benefitted by the stories of others on this site who‚Äôve been honest enough to tell us exactly how certain drugs affected them. Moreover, I do research for myself, and I can research, as you can also, any drug and its effects on http://chemocare.com/. I told my onc that I was familiar with my Carbo/Taxol combo and I wasn‚Äôt willing to go down another notch to try something else which would be more toxic and had no promise of help either. I say, ‚Äúdown‚Äù because so far, the chemo combo I‚Äôm on has shown to benefit the highest number of women who are diagnosed with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis and Ovarian Cancer. Let‚Äôs be honest, chemo is brutal but right now it‚Äôs the only game in town for my particular cancer. Immunotherapy trials are numerous and hopefully will be a breakthrough for many types of cancers, but in my particular case, this is all there is.
 Like you, I‚Äôve been tested but not been found to have any genetic basis for my cancer, although it would seem that 20 major types of cancer on my mother‚Äôs side is suspicious. One uncle and 3 of his sons all died of Lung cancer. My own sister had Breast Cancer and a mastectomy, although she survived that and died of Pneumonic Aspiration many years later. She was an invalid for 65 of her 70 years of life, and had many problems. But there was a history of Pancreatic, Breast, Lung and Colon cancer on my mom‚Äôs side. And my own brother just died in October 2017 of Pancreatic cancer two months after diagnosis. My mom was one of 12 siblings and it still seems like 20 cancers out of the number 12 is a lot. Despite no genetic correlation supposedly‚ÄîI have cancer and ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù
 But back to your problem, and it is a problem, the most I can do is give you some good sites that I found while checking up on Ovarian cysts, since all cysts are not cancerous. And when I read further on the site listed below, it sounds like something that you need to know about. I do see Endometriosis plays a role in some of the cysts. Of course, we all know that cysts can be benign or cancerous, and you‚Äôre having all the tests to find out what it is. And that is good, although painful and stressful and worrisome for you, and understandably so. You know, even as we are sure we can cope with God‚Äôs help, it doesn‚Äôt make the trip a ‚Äúcake walk!‚Äù
 So presently for me, I should have been in bed already, even though we‚Äôve had a 4-inch snow tonight here in Virginia Beach, VA because I don‚Äôt know if my treatment will be cancelled or not. (We just warmed up from a 10 ¬Ω inch snow and that‚Äôs unusual for us on the East Coast.) And I‚Äôve sworn I‚Äôm wearing a mask on my next visit. This is the flu season, and it‚Äôs a pitiful site at the oncology lab with so many mostly older folks‚ÄîI‚Äôm soon to be 79‚Äîand many of them are hacking, sneezing and coughing. And I say to myself, ‚ÄúOh dear can I get away from this person‚Äîthey are definitely sick?‚Äù The last thing we need is to leave sicker than when we came in. So don‚Äôt feel embarrassed to wear a mask. They are readily available at our lab, but I happen to have some at home. 
 Well, ‚ÄúLes‚Äù, I‚Äôve talked enough. I just thought you might need a bit of direction of what cysts can involve and I found this ‚ÄúUK‚Äù site to be user friendly. Please read it in its entirety. I‚Äôve copied lots of it, but at 45, you‚Äôre probably not ‚Äúworried about fertility‚Äù. You just want to get rid of any and everything that might cause cancer! I‚Äôm not smart enough to give you a possible diagnosis, and can‚Äôt comment on the CA-125 number except to say ‚Äú35‚Äù is the normal range for we females and other things besides cancer can cause an elevation. What you‚Äôre describing is obviously a reason for the increased CA-125 and it is cause for concern given all that you‚Äôve described. And to be honest, this article does suggest that elevated CA-125 can be a sign of cancer as well, so I just want you to be prepared to ‚Äúhear‚Äù negative or positive comments from your gyn/onc with regard to your elevated levels. Since I‚Äôm a realist, I would have to say that I would be ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù to answer your question about a 115 number. I hope this isn‚Äôt too blunt for you, but living with terminal cancer myself for the last 5 years, and my survival is a miracle‚ÄîI‚Äôm probably more blunt than most. But I feel like that you really are wanting to know for sure what is going on and as quickly as possible. You‚Äôve been through a traumatic time with cancer already!
 But let me say one thing, if your gyn/onc is talking ‚Äúhysterectomy‚Äù please leave nothing to chance‚Äîtake it all out. I only had my uterus removed at age 36, and now at 74 learned that I had Ovarian cancer. Now it is believed that actually the cancer most likely begins in the Fallopian tubes. That‚Äôs the most I can help you with. And check in as often as you feel comfortable. With my own treatments ongoing, who knows if I will be in any shape to answer? I‚Äôm sorta on a self-imposed furlough because I don‚Äôt like trying to help someone and then not be able to talk with on an ongoing basis. But such may be the case. I just felt I had to answer you to try to give you some info about cysts and how they are diagnosed and treated. Be sure to ask lots of questions. There are no dumb questions. This is your life, and if your doctor has your best interests at heart, she will certainly be a good listener. 
 I‚Äôll stop short of saying confirming your suspicions since I‚Äôm not certain what is going on with you. My conversion chart says 5 centimeters is 1.968504 Inches. (rounded to 6 decimal places). ‚ÄúNo Time for Cancer‚Äù has asked what kind of surgery are you having?‚Äù So I would be interested to know that as well. In scanning all the info links I‚Äôve listed below, I believe it said anything more than 5 centimeters should be removed. But I‚Äôm with you, ‚Äútake it out‚Äù would be my plea!
 Not sure how you feel about prayer, but we have women of prayer on here, and I‚Äôm certain they will be calling your name. It just pays to know all you can about your particular diagnosis once it is definitely established. I hope that will soon be determined for you. I pray that the doctors will be able to adequately determine the correct diagnosis and prescribe the best treatment for you, and as always, when we start to experience unexplained pain, cancer does cross our mind. May God bless you with His peace‚Äîyes it‚Äôs possible even with cancer to be at peace with God even though it seems all H_E_L_L has broken loose for us here on Planet Earth when we hear, ""You have cancer."" 
 We use the word ""sorry"" but it can't begin to describe the disappointment we all feel when we read a story like yours. 
  Love & prayers for you,
 Loretta

 Ovarian cysts and fertility
 Overview
 An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. They're very common and don't usually cause any symptoms. Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and disappear in a few months without needing any treatment‚Ä¶
 The two main types of ovarian cyst are:
 functional ovarian cysts ‚Äì cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type
 pathological ovarian cysts ‚Äì cysts that form as a result of abnormal cell growth; these are much less common
 Ovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such as endometriosis.
 The vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant). Cancerous cysts are more common in women who have been through the menopause. Read more about the causes of ovarian cysts.
 Diagnosing ovarian cysts
 If your GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an ultrasound scan, carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina.
 If a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or your GP may refer you to a gynaecologist (a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health).
 If there's any concern that your cyst could be cancerous, your doctor will also arrange blood tests to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate ovarian cancer.
 However, having high levels of these chemicals doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer, as high levels can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions such as: 
 endometriosis
 a pelvic infection
 fibroids
 your period
 Treating ovarian cysts
 Whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on:
 its size and appearance
 whether you have any symptoms
 whether you've been through the menopause
 In most cases, the cyst often disappears after a few months. A follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this.
 As post-menopausal women have a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer, regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst.
 Surgical treatment to remove the cysts may be needed if they're large, causing symptoms, or potentially cancerous.

  ‚ÄúCauses - Ovarian cysts often develop naturally in women who have monthly periods.
 They can also affect women who have been through the menopause.
 Types of ovarian cyst - There are many different types of ovarian cyst, which can be categorised as either:
 functional cysts - pathological cysts
 Functional cysts
 Functional ovarian cysts are linked to the menstrual cycle. They affect girls and women who haven't been through the menopause, and are very common. Each month, a woman's ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes into the womb (uterus), where it can be fertilised by a man's sperm.
 Each egg forms inside the ovary in a structure known as a follicle. The follicle contains fluid that protects the egg as it grows and it bursts when the egg is released. However, sometimes a follicle doesn't release an egg, or it doesn't discharge its fluid and shrink after the egg is released. If this happens, the follicle can swell and become a cyst.
 Functional cysts are non-cancerous (benign) and are usually harmless, although they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pelvic pain. Most will disappear in a few months without needing any treatment.
 Pathological cysts
 Pathological cysts are cysts caused by abnormal cell growth and aren't related to the menstrual cycle. They can develop before and after the menopause. Pathological cysts develop from either the cells used to create eggs or the cells that cover the outer part of the ovary. They can sometimes burst or grow very large and block the blood supply to the ovaries. Pathological cysts are usually non-cancerous, but a small number are cancerous (malignant) and often surgically removed.
 Conditions that cause ovarian cysts
 In some cases, ovarian cysts are caused by an underlying condition such as endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when pieces of the tissue that line the womb (endometrium) are found outside the womb in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder, bowel, vagina or rectum. Blood-filled cysts can sometimes form in this tissue.
 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that causes lots of small, harmless cysts to develop on your ovaries. The cysts are small egg follicles that don't grow to ovulation and are the result of altered hormone levels.‚Äù

 Your fertility
 Cancer treatment
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶Treatment - In most cases, ovarian cysts disappear in a few months without the need for treatment.
 Whether treatment is needed will depend on:
 its size and appearance
 whether you have any symptoms
 whether you've had the menopause ‚Äì as post-menopausal women have a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer‚Ä¶
 Surgery
 Large or persistent ovarian cysts, or cysts that are causing symptoms, usually need to be surgically removed. Surgery is also normally recommended if there are concerns that the cyst could be cancerous or could become cancerous.
 There are two types of surgery used to remove ovarian cysts:
 a laparoscopy
 a laparotomy
 These are usually carried out under general anaesthetic.
 Laparoscopy
 Most cysts can be removed using laparoscopy. This is a type of keyhole surgery where small cuts are made in your tummy and gas is blown into the pelvis to allow the surgeon to access your ovaries. A laparoscope (a small, tube-shaped microscope with a light on the end) is passed into your abdomen so the surgeon can see your internal organs. The surgeon then removes the cyst through the small cuts in your skin.
 After the cyst has been removed, the cuts will be closed using dissolvable stitches. A laparoscopy is preferred because it causes less pain and has a quicker recovery time. Most women are able to go home on the same day or the following day.
 Laparotomy
 If your cyst is particularly large, or there's a chance it could be cancerous, a laparotomy may be recommended. During a laparotomy, a single, larger cut is made in your tummy to give the surgeon better access to the cyst. The whole cyst and ovary may be removed and sent to a laboratory to check whether it's cancerous. Stitches or staples will be used to close the incision. You may need to stay in hospital for a few days after the procedure.
 After surgery
 After the ovarian cyst has been removed, you'll feel pain in your tummy, although this should improve in a day or two. Following laparoscopic surgery, you'll probably need to take things easy for two weeks. Recovery after a laparotomy usually takes longer, possibly around six to eight weeks.
 If the cyst is sent off for testing, the results should come back in a few weeks and your consultant will discuss with you whether you need any further treatment. Contact your GP if you notice the following symptoms during your recovery:
 heavy bleeding
 severe pain or swelling in your abdomen
 a high temperature (fever)
 dark or smelly vaginal discharge
 These symptoms may indicate an infection‚Ä¶‚Äù

own brother just died in october 2017 of pancreatic cancer two months after diagnosis my mom was one of 12 siblings and it still seems like 20 cancers out of the number 12 is a lot despite no genetic correlation supposedlyi have cancer and it is what it is but back to your problem and it is a problem the most i can do is give you some good sites that i found while checking up on ovarian cysts since all cysts are not cancerous and when i read further on the site listed below it sounds like something that you need to know about i do see endometriosis plays a role in some of the cysts of course we all know that cysts can be benign or cancerous and youre having all the tests to find out what it is and that is good although painful and stressful and worrisome for you and understandably so you know even as we are sure we can cope with gods help it doesnt make the trip a cake walk so presently for me i should have been in bed already even though weve had a 4inch snow tonight here in virginia beach va because i dont know if my treatment will be cancelled or not we just warmed up from a 10 inch snow and thats unusual for us on the east coast and ive sworn im wearing a mask on my next visit this is the flu season and its a pitiful site at the oncology lab with so many mostly older folksim soon to be 79and many of them are hacking sneezing and coughing and i say to myself oh dear can i get away from this personthey are definitely sick the last thing we need is to leave sicker than when we came in so dont feel embarrassed to wear a mask they are readily available at our lab but i happen to have some at home well les ive talked enough i just thought you might need a bit of direction of what cysts can involve and i found this uk site to be user friendly please read it in its entirety ive copied lots of it but at 45 youre probably not worried about fertility you just want to get rid of any and everything that might cause cancer im not smart enough to give you a possible diagnosis and cant comment on the ca125 number except to say 35 is the normal range for we females and other things besides cancer can cause an elevation what youre describing is obviously a reason for the increased ca125 and it is cause for concern given all that youve described and to be honest this article does suggest that elevated ca125 can be a sign of cancer as well so i just want you to be prepared to hear negative or positive comments from your gynonc with regard to your elevated levels since im a realist i would have to say that i would be suspicious to answer your question about a 115 number i hope this isnt too blunt for you but living with terminal cancer myself for the last 5 years and my survival is a miracleim probably more blunt than most but i feel like that you really are wanting to know for sure what is going on and as quickly as possible youve been through a traumatic time with cancer already but let me say one thing if your gynonc is talking hysterectomy please leave nothing to chancetake it all out i only had my uterus removed at age 36 and now at 74 learned that i had ovarian cancer now it is believed that actually the cancer most likely begins in the fallopian tubes thats the most i can help you with and check in as often as you feel comfortable with my own treatments ongoing who knows if i will be in any shape to answer im sorta on a selfimposed furlough because i dont like trying to help someone and then not be able to talk with on an ongoing basis but such may be the case i just felt i had to answer you to try to give you some info about cysts and how they are diagnosed and treated be sure to ask lots of questions there are no dumb questions this is your life and if your doctor has your best interests at heart she will certainly be a good listener ill stop short of saying confirming your suspicions since im not certain what is going on with you my conversion chart says 5 centimeters is 1968504 inches rounded to 6 decimal places no time for cancer has asked what kind of surgery are you having so i would be interested to know that as well in scanning all the info links ive listed below i believe it said anything more than 5 centimeters should be removed but im with you take it out would be my plea not sure how you feel about prayer but we have women of prayer on here and im certain they will be calling your name it just pays to know all you can about your particular diagnosis once it is definitely established i hope that will soon be determined for you i pray that the doctors will be able to adequately determine the correct diagnosis and prescribe the best treatment for you and as always when we start to experience unexplained pain cancer does cross our mind may god bless you with his peaceyes its possible even with cancer to be at peace with god even though it seems all h_e_l_l has broken loose for us here on planet earth when we hear you have cancer we use the word sorry but it cant begin to

are functional ovarian cysts cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and shortlived these are the most common type pathological ovarian cysts cysts that form as a result of abnormal cell growth these are much less common ovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition such as endometriosis the vast majority of ovarian cysts are noncancerous benign although a small number are cancerous malignant cancerous cysts are more common in women who have been through the menopause read more about the causes of ovarian cysts diagnosing ovarian cysts if your gp thinks you may have an ovarian cyst youll probably be referred for an ultrasound scan carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina if a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks or your gp may refer you to a gynaecologist a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health if theres any concern that your cyst could be cancerous your doctor will also arrange blood tests to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate ovarian cancer however having high levels of these chemicals doesnt necessarily mean you have cancer as high levels can also be caused by noncancerous conditions such as endometriosis a pelvic infection fibroids your period treating ovarian cysts whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on its size and appearance whether you have any symptoms whether youve been through the menopause in most cases the cyst often disappears after a few months a followup ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this as postmenopausal women have a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst surgical treatment to remove the cysts may be needed if theyre large causing symptoms or potentially cancerous read more about treating ovarian cysts _____________________________________________ 3 causes ovarian cysts often develop naturally in women who have monthly periods they can also affect women who have been through the menopause types of ovarian cyst there are many different types of ovarian cyst which can be categorised as either functional cysts pathological cysts functional cysts functional ovarian cysts are linked to the menstrual cycle they affect girls and women who havent been through the menopause and are very common each month a womans ovaries release an egg which travels down the fallopian tubes into the womb uterus where it can be fertilised by a mans sperm each egg forms inside the ovary in a structure known as a follicle the follicle contains fluid that protects the egg as it grows and it bursts when the egg is released however sometimes a follicle doesnt release an egg or it doesnt discharge its fluid and shrink after the egg is released if this happens the follicle can swell and become a cyst functional cysts are noncancerous benign and are usually harmless although they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pelvic pain most will disappear in a few months without needing any treatment pathological cysts pathological cysts are cysts caused by abnormal cell growth and arent related to the menstrual cycle they can develop before and after the menopause pathological cysts develop from either the cells used to create eggs or the cells that cover the outer part of the ovary they can sometimes burst or grow very large and block the blood supply to the ovaries pathological cysts are usually noncancerous but a small number are cancerous malignant and often surgically removed conditions that cause ovarian cysts in some cases ovarian cysts are caused by an underlying condition such as endometriosis endometriosis occurs when pieces of the tissue that line the womb endometrium are found outside the womb in the fallopian tubes ovaries bladder bowel vagina or rectum bloodfilled cysts can sometimes form in this tissue polycystic ovary syndrome pcos is a condition that causes lots of small harmless cysts to develop on your ovaries the cysts are small egg follicles that dont grow to ovulation and are the result of altered hormone levels ___________________________________________________ 4 watchful waiting surgery after surgery your fertility cancer treatment treatment in most cases ovarian cysts disappear in a few months without the need for treatment whether treatment is needed will depend on its size and appearance whether you have any symptoms whether youve had the menopause as postmenopausal women have a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer surgery large or persistent ovarian cysts or cysts that are causing symptoms usually need to be surgically removed surgery is also normally recommended if there are concerns that the cyst could be cancerous or could become cancerous there are two types of surgery used to remove ovarian cysts a laparoscopy a laparotomy these are usually carried out under general anaesthetic laparoscopy most cysts can be removed using laparoscopy this is a type of keyhole surgery where small cuts are made in your tummy and gas is blown into the pelvis to allow the surgeon to access your ovaries a laparoscope a small tubeshaped microscope with a light on the end is passed into your abdomen so the surgeon can see your internal organs the surgeon then removes the cyst through the small cuts in your skin after the cyst has been removed the cuts will be closed using dissolvable stitches a laparoscopy is preferred because it causes less pain and has a quicker recovery time most women are able to go home on the same day or the following day laparotomy if your cyst is particularly large or theres a chance it could be cancerous a laparotomy may be recommended during a laparotomy a single larger cut is made in your tummy to give the surgeon better access to the cyst the whole cyst and ovary may be removed and sent to a laboratory to check whether its cancerous stitches or staples will be used to close the incision you may need to stay in hospital for a few days after the procedure after surgery after the ovarian cyst has been removed youll feel pain in your tummy although this should improve in a day or two following laparoscopic surgery youll probably need to take things easy for two weeks recovery after a laparotomy usually takes longer possibly around six to eight weeks if the cyst is sent off for testing the results should come back in a few weeks and your consultant will discuss with you whether you need any further treatment contact your gp if you notice the following symptoms during your recovery heavy bleeding severe pain or swelling in your abdomen a high temperature

 Didn‚Äôt have time to comment on this site yesterday. My Stage IV Peritoneal Carcinomatosis/Ovarian Cancer is ever with me, and I had to go for another PET/CT Scan yesterday. My thoughts here were prompted by AMoore16's post of December 6th.

  Feeling a little low
 Hello All,
  I was diagnosed with stage I C Ovarian cancer in August of this year and my prognosis is good.
  So, why am I feeling so low and depressed? I have lost my hair, my eyelashes, most of my eyebrows, and now have the neuropathy associated with chemo. I feel less like a woman and more like a naked mole rat. Anyone else experience this""
 ____________________________________________________________
 ""Amoore16"" wants to know if anyone else is depressed when they lose their hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, etc. Haven't we all ""been there--done that?""
 This morning as I was ‚Äúdisturbing dust‚Äù the dust off the bathroom counter top, I gazed at the little antique vase filled with own ‚Äúwhite hair‚Äù from my 3rd chemo treatment completed January of 2017. Let me start by telling ""AMoore16"" that many of us have been exactly where she finds ‚Äúherself‚Äù today. Some days I‚Äôve actually felt good enough to forget that I have terminal cancer. But when I look at ""myself"" in the mirror, it says, ‚ÄúYou have no hair. You don't look so hot. You're bald! You have cancer!‚Äù This is how I deal with it. 
 Often I have a conversation with ""myself"", that way I control the ‚Äútalk back!‚Äù As I gazed at the small antique vase filled with a ‚Äúball of hair the size of a baseball‚Äù‚Äî‚Äúmyself"" said to me‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúNow Loretta why are you keeping that? It‚Äôs filled with dust and you‚Äôre never going to do anything with it? Just throw it away and save the next bunch that will fall out for the 4th time, as soon as you begin your 01-2018 treatment of Carboplatin and the ‚Äúinfamous hair snatcher ‚ÄúTaxol‚Äù! 
 Then ‚ÄúI‚Äù said to ""myself"", ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre right. Throw it away. However, I should have saved the other 3 ‚Äúcollections‚Äù, now I would have a ‚Äúquartet‚Äù and it could remind me of how many times I‚Äôve made it through!‚Äù
 By November of this year I had at least 3 ¬Ω inches of new hair, though sparsely scattered upon my scalp. Even though I knew I was pushing the limit by putting off more treatments till January 2018, I decided that a trip to the beautician might be the best gift I could give myself this Christmas. (By the way, I'm never disappointed when I buy my own Christmas presents, how about you?)
 So I went by the beauty Shoppe‚Äîsnatched off my turban and false bangs, wearily lifted up a wisp of hair, and said, ‚ÄúCan you get a perm roller around this?‚Äù To my surprise, she said, ‚ÄúYES‚Äù. So I made the appointment and gladly paid the $80 bucks to look in the mirror and see some curls instead of the baby-fine absolutely straight hair that I have. I feel better when I look in the mirror, but my cancer is still growing on the inside. And yes for the Christmas holidays, I will have hair, hair everywhere and not a strand to spare! 
 So yes, we‚Äôre not as ‚Äúpretty‚Äù as we are with a full head of hair to those who can only see the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù but there is a tradeoff‚Äîit‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on ‚Äúinside‚Äù. 
 So my choices are‚Äîwould I rather have cancer growing uncontrollably on the inside--forego the chemo and look good on my way to the grave with a full head of hair? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm headed if I choose to do nothing. And at this time, my quality of life is too good to ‚Äúthrow in the towel and settle for ‚Äúlookin‚Äô good instead of ‚Äúfeelin‚Äô good!‚Äù 
 I like Amoore's first sentence‚Äî‚ÄúI was diagnosed with stage I C Ovarian cancer in August of this year and my prognosis is good.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt that the best news? I should say so! So if I could ""see Amoore"" and talk to her in person, this is what I would say:
 ""May I suggest that ‚Äúyou and yourself‚Äù have a talk? When you look in the mirror and ‚Äúyourself‚Äù says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bald‚Äîremember how much better you looked with hair?‚Äù 
 Tell HER, ‚ÄúYeah, I remember. No, I don‚Äôt feel as pretty or feminine as I do when I have a full head of hair‚Äîbut it‚Äôs only hair and it‚Äôll grow back. BUT thank God I‚ÄôM ALIVE and my prognosis is good!""
 You could always write a note to ‚Äúyourself‚Äù on the mirror, with a permanent magic marker. You could say,
 ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, alright already! I know I don‚Äôt look so hot
 ‚Äîbut‚ÄîMY PROGNOSIS IS GOOD!"" 
 Knowing just how you feel‚ÄîI am,
 Your OC Stage IV Sister‚Äîw/a ‚Äúnot-so-good‚Äù prognosis but not depressed‚Äîsoon 2-B-Bald for the 4th X
 Loretta (5 yr. survivor of Stage IV Ovarian Cancer, Peritoneal Carcinomatosis)

 P.S. And on another note--speaking of dust on my countertop--I'm thinking about ordering some ""dust magnets"" to give to my guests that may visit during the holidays. I only have one magnet now--but I need to order some more. It says:
 ""You can touch the dust 
 --but please don't write in it!""",good morning didnt have time to comment on this site yesterday my stage iv peritoneal carcinomatosisovarian cancer is ever with me and i had to go for another petct scan yesterday my thoughts here were prompted by amoore16s post of december 6th _________________________________________________________ amoore16 feeling a little low hello all i was diagnosed with stage i c ovarian cancer in august of this year and my prognosis is good so why am i feeling so low and depressed i have lost my hair my eyelashes most of my eyebrows and now have the neuropathy associated with chemo i feel less like a woman and more like a naked mole rat anyone else experience this ____________________________________________________________ amoore16 wants to know if anyone else is depressed when they lose their hair eyebrows eyelashes etc havent we all been theredone that this morning as i was disturbing dust the dust off the bathroom counter top i gazed at the little antique vase filled with own white hair from my 3rd chemo treatment completed january of 2017 let me start by telling amoore16 that many of us have been exactly where she finds herself today some days ive actually felt good enough to forget that i have terminal cancer but when i look at myself in the mirror it says you have no hair you dont look so hot youre bald you have cancer this is how i deal with it often i have a conversation with myself that way i control the talk back as i gazed at the small antique vase filled with a ball of hair the size of a baseballmyself said to menow loretta why are you keeping that its filled with dust and youre never going to do anything with it just throw it away and save the next bunch that will fall out for the 4th time as soon as you begin your 012018 treatment of carboplatin and the infamous hair snatcher taxol then i said to myself well youre right throw it away however i should have saved the other 3 collections now i would have a quartet and it could remind me of how many times ive made it through by november of this year i had at least 3 inches of new hair though sparsely scattered upon my scalp even though i knew i was pushing the limit by putting off more treatments till january 2018 i decided that a trip to the beautician might be the best gift i could give myself this christmas by the way im never disappointed when i buy my own christmas presents how about you so i went by the beauty shoppesnatched off my turban and false bangs wearily lifted up a wisp of hair and said can you get a perm roller around this to my surprise she said yes so i made the appointment and gladly paid the 80 bucks to look in the mirror and see some curls instead of the babyfine absolutely straight hair that i have i feel better when i look in the mirror but my cancer is still growing on the inside and yes for the christmas holidays i will have hair hair everywhere and not a strand to spare so yes were not as pretty as we are with a full head of hair to those who can only see the outside but there is a tradeoffits whats going on inside so my choices arewould i rather have cancer growing uncontrollably on the insideforego the chemo and look good on my way to the grave with a full head of hair thats where im headed if i choose to do nothing and at this time my quality of life is too good to throw in the towel and settle for lookin good instead of feelin good i like amoores first sentencei was diagnosed with stage i c ovarian cancer in august of this year and my prognosis is good isnt that the best news i should say so so if i could see amoore and talk to her in person this is what i would say may i suggest that you and yourself have a talk when you look in the mirror and yourself says youre baldremember how much better you looked with hair tell her yeah i remember no i dont feel as pretty or feminine as i do when i have a full head of hairbut its only hair and itll grow back but thank god im alive and my prognosis is good you could always write a note to yourself on the mirror with a permanent magic marker you could say yeah yeah alright already i know i dont look so hot butmy prognosis is good knowing just how you feeli am your oc stage iv sisterwa notsogood prognosis but not depressedsoon 2bbald for the 4th x loretta 5 yr survivor of stage iv ovarian cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis _____________________________________________________________________________ ps and on another notespeaking of dust on my countertopim thinking about ordering some dust magnets to give to my guests that may visit during the holidays i only have one magnet nowbut i need to order some more it says you can touch the dust but please dont write in it,"Carboplatin, Taxol",Yes,High,"hair loss, eyelashes loss, eyebrows loss, neuropathy, depression","hair loss, eyelashes loss, eyebrows loss"
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/303397/new-ca125-numbers-update,"Hello Ladies!!!!!
 My lovely wife Michele is doing terrific with what she calls her ""Cleansing Treatments"", you know, the usual chemo drug mix. She's no longer a total newbie to all this stuff, as she just had her 8th out of 18 treatments. As I said before, her initial CA125 was over 2,000 and after surgery it fell to 424 if I remember right. A week after the 3rd treatment it fell to 179 and we got wind last Wednesday that a week after her 6th treatment her number was 112. I know, I know, you have all seen this before, and this is old hat, and newbies usually respond very well, and I bet most of you could have guessed her progress. But with all that, we are mostly elated that she's getting such good care and that her body is responding in a very positive way. In a nut shell, she's almost NEVER been sick at all with the chemo, I mean Cleansing Treatments. She didn't start losing her hair until like 4 or 5 weeks in, and it only partially fell out, but we decided to give her the buzz cut and she was excited to try her wig, which looks nearly spot on from her normal hair. She mostly goes without it and has only worn it twice the past 3 weeks or so. A really neat ballcap has been her choice, it's the designer kind. She did have a mild scare with her white blood count low so she had to wear a mask some and watch being around anyone. Now the past 3 weeks her hemoglobin has been declining and had it been any lower, they would not have given her treatment today. I think it was 9.5 and they want it 12 to 14. The won't give the treatment if it reaches 9, so Michele is afraid of that. She went for a two mile walk yesterday, and they told her not to do that anymore and to get more rest than she normally does. I don't know what she should do and what she shouldn't do. They told her to eat more protein. Do any of you have any suggestions, and how do you feel the assesment I have shown here? I'm always excited to learn from all of you and I appreciate hearing what you all have to say. I am sure it is hard to watch for some of you because you know the road map for a stage 3C or 4 patient, and how excited they get when they think they are beating this. And I also know that the road ahead might not always be peachy. I've read enough about all the wonderful women who brave this fight on this page, and I am a realist, but I don't for a single minute pretend to be the know it all, and don't ever want to display weakness in front of Michele. She's 46 and an incredible fighter. Michele was Ms. Kansas Drill Team winner & she used to be a cheerleader for the Kansas City Chiefs, and she's coached hundreds of young ladies to winning national championships. She's got what great women are made of, and knowing her, and reading this page, women are way tougher than men. When I am all alone like I am right now, I let a little tiny bit of negativity to creap in and I dred to ever see her fight slipping through her fingers. I know you women have seen it all on this page and have lost some very inspirational women and leaders on the page. I can tell you, that reading their stories and progress keeps their spirit alive in me and I plan on being a great care giver. I am sad there are not more care givers on this page learning from all of you like I am. Thanks for listening, I love you all......big john",hello ladies my lovely wife michele is doing terrific with what she calls her cleansing treatments you know the usual chemo drug mix shes no longer a total newbie to all this stuff as she just had her 8th out of 18 treatments as i said before her initial ca125 was over 2000 and after surgery it fell to 424 if i remember right a week after the 3rd treatment it fell to 179 and we got wind last wednesday that a week after her 6th treatment her number was 112 i know i know you have all seen this before and this is old hat and newbies usually respond very well and i bet most of you could have guessed her progress but with all that we are mostly elated that shes getting such good care and that her body is responding in a very positive way in a nut shell shes almost never been sick at all with the chemo i mean cleansing treatments she didnt start losing her hair until like 4 or 5 weeks in and it only partially fell out but we decided to give her the buzz cut and she was excited to try her wig which looks nearly spot on from her normal hair she mostly goes without it and has only worn it twice the past 3 weeks or so a really neat ballcap has been her choice its the designer kind she did have a mild scare with her white blood count low so she had to wear a mask some and watch being around anyone now the past 3 weeks her hemoglobin has been declining and had it been any lower they would not have given her treatment today i think it was 95 and they want it 12 to 14 the wont give the treatment if it reaches 9 so michele is afraid of that she went for a two mile walk yesterday and they told her not to do that anymore and to get more rest than she normally does i dont know what she should do and what she shouldnt do they told her to eat more protein do any of you have any suggestions and how do you feel the assesment i have shown here im always excited to learn from all of you and i appreciate hearing what you all have to say i am sure it is hard to watch for some of you because you know the road map for a stage 3c or 4 patient and how excited they get when they think they are beating this and i also know that the road ahead might not always be peachy ive read enough about all the wonderful women who brave this fight on this page and i am a realist but i dont for a single minute pretend to be the know it all and dont ever want to display weakness in front of michele shes 46 and an incredible fighter michele was ms kansas drill team winner she used to be a cheerleader for the kansas city chiefs and shes coached hundreds of young ladies to winning national championships shes got what great women are made of and knowing her and reading this page women are way tougher than men when i am all alone like i am right now i let a little tiny bit of negativity to creap in and i dred to ever see her fight slipping through her fingers i know you women have seen it all on this page and have lost some very inspirational women and leaders on the page i can tell you that reading their stories and progress keeps their spirit alive in me and i plan on being a great care giver i am sad there are not more care givers on this page learning from all of you like i am thanks for listening i love you allbig john,not mentioned,Yes,Moderate,"hair loss, low white blood count, declining hemoglobin",hair loss
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/314310/looking-for-hope,"So, I guess it started in March 2016. At age 50, my Mom started having awful periods, very painful and heavier than ever before. I work in OBGYN, so I thought this was just perimenopausal symptoms, as did my provider. So an ultrasound was done, everything is normal besides her uterus is slightly long and her left ovary has multiple follicles. She is considering an ablation but the doctor does not think she is a good candidate because of the size of her uterus. So she decides to hold out to see if the awful periods just stop their own. They Don‚Äôt. Come October 2016, periods are worse than before, she wants something done. They decide to go with an IUD, so that is inserted the same day. Everything is awesome for a year. Periods are nonexistent, cramping has stopped, she loves the IUD. Come 06/2017, she starts having pain and swelling in her right ankle. PCP thinks it‚Äôs Gout. Gives her medicine for that which does nothing. She calls her back and says she is no better. I asked for her to get an doppler of her leg to check for DVT. Her PCP is not convinced. PCP says let‚Äôs order an X-ray to check for injury (there was no injury) I talk to Dr. S who is worried and says its no issue to order one, so she did. Low and Behold she has a DVT. Mom gets put on Xaralto for 3 months, the clot resolves fairly quickly. Then she is taken off. Forward to October 19th, 2017, Im leaving for work and she's complaining of lower abdominal pain. First thing I think of is something is wrong with the IUD, So I asked her to come in ASAP for an ultrasound to make sure it‚Äôs still in the right place. So we get her in, ultrasound first then seeing the doctor. Ultrasound shows normal left ovary BUT cannot see right ovary because of large complex mass measuring at least 15cm, with blood flow. She has a cruise scheduled the very next day to Mexico. So Doctor S. says go ahead and go, we will take care of everything when you get back. At first Doctor S. thinks its just a large complex cyst (Benign), but since it is so large it needs to come out. Doctor S. said since her periods are bad already, let‚Äôs do a hysterectomy with right oophorectomy. But with the cyst being so large, she will have to make a vertical incision. So mom gets back from her trip, following day Doctor S. wants some blood work in anticipation for surgery. Also, mom was complaining of pain in her left leg now after the long car ride from mexico. So another doppler was ordered. She ended up having 2 DVT‚Äôs in that leg. She was kept in the hospital to have an IVC filter, which prevents DVT‚Äôs traveling to the lungs. (She ended up already having multiple Pulmonary Embolisms at the time that wasn't known.) She Orders a CBC, CMP, and CA 125. Everything came back fine EXCEPT CA 125 was 2939, which is supposed to be 35 and below. So RED FLAG RED FLAG RED FLAG. Dr. S still doesn‚Äôt seem too worried, she thinks it is a Low malignant potential tumor. So she consults with one of her best oncology colleagues, which is Dr. Murray. Dr. Murray seems actually very worried, with the size of the mass, her very high CA 125, and with recurrent DVT‚Äôs. Now Dr. Murray is doing the surgery instead of Dr. S. We meet with Dr. Murray, she tells us straight up she thinks this is Ovarian Cancer. So now we have to wait a little over one month for surgery because Dr. Murray is worried about the blood clots. Come December 1st, surgery lasts for about 4-5 hours. She did a Hysterectomy w/BSO, appendectomy and omenectomy. Took multiple biopsies from everywhere, and ended up taking 15 lymph nodes. We are told it is cancer, but that it looks to be stage 1C. The tumor was not really adhered to anything at all, there was fluid from part of the tumor rupturing. About 1 week later we have her first post op, where she tells us she is now stage 3C. There is cancer in 2 lower lymph nodes and well as 1 along the aorta. Literally EVERYTHING else is negative for cancer. Uterus, left ovary, appendix, pelvic washings, all biopsies. I‚Äôve never seen a story like this, I‚Äôve always seen stage 3C where there are tumors everywhere in the abdomen. So to hear this is shocking. We were expecting good (considering) news and now it‚Äôs just awful. Oh, also when the CT scan was done to look for PE's, they found a nodule. She is a former smoker so I know it could be scar tissue or something. Dr. Murray doesn't seem to be that worried about that being cancer because there is not free fluid around it but she will be watching it. If it is then that means the cancer is stage 4. She will start chemo tomorrow, January 11th. Chemo will be 6 cycles of Carboplatin and Taxotere. I know she is in good hands with her Gynecologic Oncology doctor but I am absolutely terrified. I just want to hear stories, any helpful advice. Sorry this is so long, please let me know if you have any questions.",so i guess it started in march 2016 at age 50 my mom started having awful periods very painful and heavier than ever before i work in obgyn so i thought this was just perimenopausal symptoms as did my provider so an ultrasound was done everything is normal besides her uterus is slightly long and her left ovary has multiple follicles she is considering an ablation but the doctor does not think she is a good candidate because of the size of her uterus so she decides to hold out to see if the awful periods just stop their own they dont come october 2016 periods are worse than before she wants something done they decide to go with an iud so that is inserted the same day everything is awesome for a year periods are nonexistent cramping has stopped she loves the iud come 062017 she starts having pain and swelling in her right ankle pcp thinks its gout gives her medicine for that which does nothing she calls her back and says she is no better i asked for her to get an doppler of her leg to check for dvt her pcp is not convinced pcp says lets order an xray to check for injury there was no injury i talk to dr s who is worried and says its no issue to order one so she did low and behold she has a dvt mom gets put on xaralto for 3 months the clot resolves fairly quickly then she is taken off forward to october 19th 2017 im leaving for work and shes complaining of lower abdominal pain first thing i think of is something is wrong with the iud so i asked her to come in asap for an ultrasound to make sure its still in the right place so we get her in ultrasound first then seeing the doctor ultrasound shows normal left ovary but cannot see right ovary because of large complex mass measuring at least 15cm with blood flow she has a cruise scheduled the very next day to mexico so doctor s says go ahead and go we will take care of everything when you get back at first doctor s thinks its just a large complex cyst benign but since it is so large it needs to come out doctor s said since her periods are bad already lets do a hysterectomy with right oophorectomy but with the cyst being so large she will have to make a vertical incision so mom gets back from her trip following day doctor s wants some blood work in anticipation for surgery also mom was complaining of pain in her left leg now after the long car ride from mexico so another doppler was ordered she ended up having 2 dvts in that leg she was kept in the hospital to have an ivc filter which prevents dvts traveling to the lungs she ended up already having multiple pulmonary embolisms at the time that wasnt known she orders a cbc cmp and ca 125 everything came back fine except ca 125 was 2939 which is supposed to be 35 and below so red flag red flag red flag dr s still doesnt seem too worried she thinks it is a low malignant potential tumor so she consults with one of her best oncology colleagues which is dr murray dr murray seems actually very worried with the size of the mass her very high ca 125 and with recurrent dvts now dr murray is doing the surgery instead of dr s we meet with dr murray she tells us straight up she thinks this is ovarian cancer so now we have to wait a little over one month for surgery because dr murray is worried about the blood clots come december 1st surgery lasts for about 45 hours she did a hysterectomy wbso appendectomy and omenectomy took multiple biopsies from everywhere and ended up taking 15 lymph nodes we are told it is cancer but that it looks to be stage 1c the tumor was not really adhered to anything at all there was fluid from part of the tumor rupturing about 1 week later we have her first post op where she tells us she is now stage 3c there is cancer in 2 lower lymph nodes and well as 1 along the aorta literally everything else is negative for cancer uterus left ovary appendix pelvic washings all biopsies ive never seen a story like this ive always seen stage 3c where there are tumors everywhere in the abdomen so to hear this is shocking we were expecting good considering news and now its just awful oh also when the ct scan was done to look for pes they found a nodule she is a former smoker so i know it could be scar tissue or something dr murray doesnt seem to be that worried about that being cancer because there is not free fluid around it but she will be watching it if it is then that means the cancer is stage 4 she will start chemo tomorrow january 11th chemo will be 6 cycles of carboplatin and taxotere i know she is in good hands with her gynecologic oncology doctor but i am absolutely terrified i just want to hear stories any helpful advice sorry this is so long please let me know if you have any questions,"Xaralto, Carboplatin, Taxotere",Yes,High,"pain and swelling in her right ankle, DVT, pain in her left leg, multiple Pulmonary Embolisms, cancer, stage 3C, nodule, former smoker, chemotherapy, terrified",pain and swelling in her right ankle

 I've just joined the site this evening. I completed my 18 weeks of Taxol/Carbo treatment 5 weeks ago today. I did very well on the chemo with relatively few side effects apart from weight gain (arghhhh) and hair loss. Anyway about 2-3 weeks after completing the treatment i started to get aching muscles and painful joints especially knees and fingers. The only way i can describe the feeling is like having done a huge workout at the gym after not going to the gym for 6 months - that's what the muscle pain feels like, the joint pain feels like what i suppose arthritis must feel like, it's painful to bend my knees and generally move around. I didn't have any of these symptoms prior to chemo and i'm only 46 so i don't think it's age related arthritis!!! I have spoken to the oncology nurse and she says that these side effects can happen but aren't that common. Has anyone else experienced this after completing their treatment. Also nearly all my eyebrows and eyelashes have fallen out since i've finished the treatment NOT whilst i was undergoing it - weird!!!",hi ive just joined the site this evening i completed my 18 weeks of taxolcarbo treatment 5 weeks ago today i did very well on the chemo with relatively few side effects apart from weight gain arghhhh and hair loss anyway about 23 weeks after completing the treatment i started to get aching muscles and painful joints especially knees and fingers the only way i can describe the feeling is like having done a huge workout at the gym after not going to the gym for 6 months thats what the muscle pain feels like the joint pain feels like what i suppose arthritis must feel like its painful to bend my knees and generally move around i didnt have any of these symptoms prior to chemo and im only 46 so i dont think its age related arthritis i have spoken to the oncology nurse and she says that these side effects can happen but arent that common has anyone else experienced this after completing their treatment also nearly all my eyebrows and eyelashes have fallen out since ive finished the treatment not whilst i was undergoing it weird,"Taxol, Carbo",Yes,Moderate,"weight gain, hair loss, aching muscles, painful joints, pain in knees, pain in fingers, loss of eyebrows, loss of eyelashes"," hair loss, loss of eyebrows, loss of eyelashes"

She is two weeks post surgery and has begun experiencing tremendous abdominal pain -- on a scale from 1 to 10, she said it's a 20. The pain literally brought her to her knees this afternoon (and she has a high pain tolerance). Fortunately, she was at the surgeon's office for a follow up visit when it occurred. He examined her and said everything looked ok -- what she was experiencing was normal for the type of major surgery she had. He also reminded her that she needs to take her pain pills to stay ahead of the pain, which she had not been doing. (But, my mom claims she didn't need the pain pills for the last week -- this mega pain just hit her with no warning.)
 This extreme pain has been coming in waves for most of the day and continuing now into the night. She is literally in tears trying to cope and counting the minutes until her next pain pill (Dilaudid).

I also have bad knees and need both replaced. I am on constant pain with these thoughI have a scrip for painkillers --I can't take NSAID's, like many people. The surgery scars still hurt badly--though the surgery was at the beginning of February. My doctor says there are a lot of nerves in the rib/thoracic area and it may be a full year before I can wear a bra again. In addition I have edema in my left left and am on a diuretic. Also a blood thinner because after botched knee surgery last December I got multiple blood clots again -- I have a history of these though I don't have the gene which means only that this gene I carry just hasn't been identified yet. Also my CA 125 is not a reliable indicator for me. I've basically been on bedrest since last December with my knees and I've gained a huge aount of weight which isn't really a vanity issue but 'wardrobe economics' since I need new clothese.
 I was doing OK until last Saturday morning--I was cheerful and positive-- when I suddenly had a meltdown in the kitchen and burst into tears. Luckily my husband is sympathetic. 
 But then Sunday evening watching tv I had my back to him and heald an end table fall over and a big noise -- he had too much to drink and fell on the floor and couldn't get up. He was crying and saying ""I want you back, I miss you, I'm afraid you're going to die and I can't live without you."" And this went on for about an hour. I lay down on the carpet with him and held him and let him cry. I had to help him get up. 
 He has his own problems, he is getting Lupron for advanced prostate cancer, but the Lupron is working, which is good, his PSA is way down. However the Lupron is basically female hormones, and its as if he's going through menopause. It makes him emotionally volatile, up and down, irritable at times, etc. So I think the Lupron contributed to Sunday's event.
 But somehow this was the last straw. I rrealise I am tryig to act like I feel OK when I feel ill, and its just too much. Now I feel weepy all the time, and I go to the bathroom and cry. I feel I can't cope, but I don't have any choice. I'm geting phobic about needles. Going for chemo yesterday I had to take a tranquiliser, I just couldn't bear it.

I went to my gynecologist and he did vaginal ultra sound and could tell I was in a lot of pain but didn't see any cysts or anything. He did do the ca125 test and will be doing ct scan Monday. I know sometimes the blood test can be normal and scans not show anything. He said depending on what my test and scan shows we should do laparoscopy to see why the pain.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/309690/lynparza-a-separate-reply-2-pandagypsy-re-her-upcoming-treatment-if-she-can-afford-it-video-p,"Dear ‚ÄúPandaGypsy‚Äù ~
 I read your very post here at this link: https://csn.cancer.org/node/309418
 Since I had no personal experience ‚Äúfirsthand‚Äù with Lynparza I didn‚Äôt respond. However, I have had ‚Äúfirst hand‚Äù experience with having my ‚Äúomentum‚Äù removed, but that wasn‚Äôt your question. I see on your ‚Äúabout me‚Äù page (Expressions section) that you had a lumpectomy for Breast Cancer and 4 months of ‚Äúnasty chemo and radiation‚Äù. Since I‚Äôm not familiar with your cancer other than that, can you tell me exactly what your diagnosis reads now? I‚Äôm assuming that it has now progressed to some other organ since you are now considered terminal. 
 Since I too am a terminal Ovarian Cancer patient, and since I had seen the drug name ‚ÄúLynparza‚Äù several times, I decided to do a little more research on it. And since I spent so much time reading about what its intended purpose is, I decided to post my reply to you here, instead of below your original post regarding the high cost of this drug. That way others will learn at least as much as I have learned. So below my name, I‚Äôve listed several youtube videos as well as medical articles referencing the use and purpose of ‚ÄúLynparza‚Äù. 
 But first I want to say that I‚Äôm glad to see that you have learned an important lesson very quickly‚ÄîYOU MUST BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE. Moreover, you have to become a lay nurse, and find research on the kind of cancer you have, and then discuss it with your doctor. As for drugs, I know that there is a ‚Äútier‚Äù system to the drugs, and that different companies will put meds on different tiers. They cost more on one tier than another, and it‚Äôs their prerogative as to which tier they place it on. That‚Äôs one thing to consider when trying to figure out which policy to purchase. All companies do not put Carboplatin on the same tier for instance. An ‚ÄúHMO‚Äù isn‚Äôt noted for the most generous provisions based on people that I know who have them. 
 I‚Äôve found from reading oh so many posts that few doctors are going to tell you what you need to know, unless you know what questions to ask. I know one young lady from Canada, (national healthcare country) had no choice of doctors‚Äîwas assigned one‚Äîwas told what would be done‚Äîwaited weeks before calling back after no one had contacted her‚Äîresult she called again‚Äîpapers were still lying on a worker‚Äôs desk‚Äîhad never been sent ANYWHERE! So yes, you have to be a ‚Äúhound‚Äù as well, and ‚Äútrack down‚Äù your own paperwork and you do have to be persistent. I‚Äôve now gotten a bill‚Äînothing like your drug bill though‚Äîhave called on 3 separate occasions to say, ‚ÄúYou have my policy #. This bill should be covered!‚Äù And so now, for the third time, I‚Äôve given them my policy info. This is for treatment months ago. And so you also have to be a bookkeeper and an accountant. And something else I note is that the first bill that comes in will have the date of treatment. Subsequent bills for the same treatment can come in, but the rest do not necessarily still have the date of treatment. Sometimes the bills come in quickly, and sometimes they seem to lag far behind the treatment date. 
 Long ago, I began buying a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù calendar from an office supply store that shows all days of the month on one page with blocks big enough to write on. I have one on the side of my refrigerator. And so I write on it the date of my appointments and treatments. Often I have to go back to that to see what on earth this bill is for. Although the bills are almost always paid for, if the bill doesn‚Äôt have what the treatment is for, I have to check my calendar. Otherwise, I can‚Äôt be certain that this bill isn‚Äôt a duplicate of something that has already been paid for once! 
 Moreover, I have kept a record of my treatments in my WORD file, so when I go for a new doctor, I just print out my medical history. And where it asks what medical treatments, surgeries, etc. have you had, I just write ‚Äúsee attached medical history.‚Äù This saves me lots of time. Now sometimes the doctors will send me those forms in the mail and request that I fill them out prior to my visit, but some do not. I, for one, have not committed to memory all the dates of surgeries in the last 78 years. Now, naturally I do remember the dates of my 3 boys‚Äô birthdates‚Äîintense pain‚Äîand my biggest surgery, that being ‚ÄúCytoreductive Surgery‚Äù, July 1, 2013. 
 And one more thing I do, each time I have a scan of any kind, I tell them ahead of time that I would like a copy of the scan, as well as the written report when it becomes available. But I do come home with a copy of the scan the same day, or I can wait a couple of days and pick up both the scan and the accompanying report.
 Well, I‚Äôve said all that to say this. Although at the first, I thought the receptionist was just going to put you off. Greg, the financial fellow, was really busy and the nurse who usually fills out these kind of papers isn‚Äôt in, so were you supposed to just ‚Äúgo home‚Äù papers in hand and wait for a call? I imagine your ‚Äúcolorful‚Äù language is what got the receptionist‚Äôs attention. By now she understood that someone was going to have to take care of you and she was ‚Äúit‚Äù. She did the right thing! I certainly would give her a special ""thanks"" for realizing that you were adamant as well as desperate. I‚Äôm glad you got those papers ‚Äúsigned, sealed and delivered!‚Äù
 So let‚Äôs see now, in addition to being the patient, you have to be your own researcher, advocate, intercessor, accountant/bookkeeper, financial advisor and mail lady! 
  And how much are you getting paid? I‚Äôm hoping this is going to ‚Äúpay off‚Äù in having your medicine provided for you almost free of charge, if not free. I know lots of people that are getting ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù that they really could pay for, but instead they know ‚Äúhow to work the system‚Äù. But I won‚Äôt detail by what I mean here, but it is aggravating when someone has to figure out how many hoops they have to jump through to have something that should have been provided them in the first place.
 And one more, may I add ‚Äúscheduler‚Äù to your list. Sometimes you have to be forceful to get an appointment when you need it! I specifically remember one of my friends on the Esophageal Cancer site who, when she called the doctor about her husband‚Äôs problems, was told by the receptionist that her husband was progressing normally, and that she would have to wait until his next regularly-scheduled appointment to see the doctor. My friend wasn‚Äôt forceful. Needless to say her husband suffered greatly during the interim. So often we have to summon up the courage and decide we will not take ‚ÄúNO‚Äù for an answer.
 And one more thing, as usual, I note that one of the side effects of taking Lynparza is nausea. During my 3 different regimens of chemo thus far, I‚Äôve found that taking my anti-nausea med each morning the very first thing before I have any symptoms of nausea, kept me from becoming nauseous. My medicine was ‚ÄúGranisetron‚Äù trade name KYTRIL. Clinical trials have proven it to be more effective than ‚ÄúZofran‚Äù for nausea. Just thought you might want to know that as I‚Äôm certain your doctor will prescribe some form of antiemetic. 
 Here‚Äôs hoping that Lynparza will prove to be effective so that checking in with Hospice will not be your only option any time soon! 
 Love & prayers for you ""Gypsy""

 P.S. I‚Äôve looked up info on ‚ÄúLynparza‚Äù as it may be something my oncologist might recommend once I become resistant to the current platin drugs. Of course, I never know what a day will bring, but others reading your letter may also want to know more about this drug that is given in pill form. This list is by no means exhaustive but can serve as an introduction for those who might have Lynparza prescribed for them in the future.

 How Cells Divide and How Chemotherapy Works
 Uploaded on Jan 23, 2012
 A cell is the functional basic unit of life, often called the building block of life. Humans have about 100 trillion cells. Your body is constantly producing new cells.
  In this program, we will discuss how cells divide, how chemotherapy affects cells that are dividing, and how chemotherapy affects cancer cells.
  When a normal cell divides, it goes through a series of steps, including a duplication of its DNA, which contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of living organisms.
  The end result of the cell division is the formation of two identical daughter cells.
 Let's begin to explore how this process happens. The cell goes through many distinct steps as it divides‚Ä¶‚Äù

 ‚ÄúLynparza‚Ñ¢ - Generic name: Olaparib
 Lynparza ‚Ñ¢ is the trade name for the generic chemotherapy drug olaparib. In some cases, health care professionals may use the generic name olaparib when referring to the trade drug name Lynparza‚Ñ¢‚Ä¶
 How Lynparza Works:
 Targeted therapy is the result of about 100 years of research dedicated to understanding the differences between cancer cells and normal cells. To date, cancer treatment has focused primarily on killing rapidly dividing cells because one feature of cancer cells is that they divide rapidly. Unfortunately, some of our normal cells divide rapidly too, causing multiple side effects.
 Targeted therapy is about identifying other features of cancer cells. Scientists look for specific differences in the cancer cells and the normal cells. This information is used to create a targeted therapy to attack the cancer cells without damaging the normal cells, thus leading to fewer side effects. Each type of targeted therapy works a little bit differently but all interfere with the ability of the cancer cell to grow, divide, repair and/or communicate with other cells.
 There are different types of targeted therapies, defined in three broad categories. Some targeted therapies focus on the internal components and function of the cancer cell. The targeted therapies use small molecules that can get into the cell and disrupt the function of the cells, causing them to die. There are several types of targeted therapy that focus on the inner parts of the cells.
 Other targeted therapies target receptors that are on the outside of the cell. Therapies that target receptors are also known as monoclonal antibodies...""

 _______________________End of references_____________________________________________________",dear pandagypsy i read your very post here at this link since i had no personal experience firsthand with lynparza i didnt respond however i have had first hand experience with having my omentum removed but that wasnt your question i see on your about me page expressions section that you had a lumpectomy for breast cancer and 4 months of nasty chemo and radiation since im not familiar with your cancer other than that can you tell me exactly what your diagnosis reads now im assuming that it has now progressed to some other organ since you are now considered terminal since i too am a terminal ovarian cancer patient and since i had seen the drug name lynparza several times i decided to do a little more research on it and since i spent so much time reading about what its intended purpose is i decided to post my reply to you here instead of below your original post regarding the high cost of this drug that way others will learn at least as much as i have learned so below my name ive listed several youtube videos as well as medical articles referencing the use and purpose of lynparza but first i want to say that im glad to see that you have learned an important lesson very quicklyyou must be your own advocate moreover you have to become a lay nurse and find research on the kind of cancer you have and then discuss it with your doctor as for drugs i know that there is a tier system to the drugs and that different companies will put meds on different tiers they cost more on one tier than another and its their prerogative as to which tier they place it on thats one thing to consider when trying to figure out which policy to purchase all companies do not put carboplatin on the same tier for instance an hmo isnt noted for the most generous provisions based on people that i know who have them ive found from reading oh so many posts that few doctors are going to tell you what you need to know unless you know what questions to ask i know one young lady from canada national healthcare country had no choice of doctorswas assigned onewas told what would be donewaited weeks before calling back after no one had contacted herresult she called againpapers were still lying on a workers deskhad never been sent anywhere so yes you have to be a hound as well and track down your own paperwork and you do have to be persistent ive now gotten a billnothing like your drug bill thoughhave called on 3 separate occasions to say you have my policy this bill should be covered and so now for the third time ive given them my policy info this is for treatment months ago and so you also have to be a bookkeeper and an accountant and something else i note is that the first bill that comes in will have the date of treatment subsequent bills for the same treatment can come in but the rest do not necessarily still have the date of treatment sometimes the bills come in quickly and sometimes they seem to lag far behind the treatment date long ago i began buying a large calendar from an office supply store that shows all days of the month on one page with blocks big enough to write on i have one on the side of my refrigerator and so i write on it the date of my appointments and treatments often i have to go back to that to see what on earth this bill is for

 Hello--anyone taking Avastin and Abraxane ?
 This is my fourth go-round with ovarian cancer.
 A rare, spontaneous metastas--a tumor-- popped up in in the upper lobe of my right lung, out of the blue. My last go round was 2009. The surgery was terrible: I hemhorraged the first night--so back into the operating theater for a second chest drain. Then the second night my blood was so low I was given a transfustion. I credit the night nurse, David, at Weill-Cornell, for saving my life. I could have bled out. 
 Recovery was very difficult. The wounds itched unbearably. My surgeon said he had never seen this happen before. That was February 3 2017. Now, May 14 2017, the wounds still give me pain, for which I have a topical cream. 
 Currently, I am on Avastin and Abraxane which I started four weeks ago. I get treatment Fridays. Two weeks of Abraxane, followed by a third week of Abraxane and Avastin. The fourth week I get a 'chemo holiday'. 
 I was very sick this week. I spent most of Tuesday in a stupor and slept round the clock. Terrible problems with chemo-constipation. Now taking Miralax daily and drinking lots of fluids. 
 Last Friday, I began to have aches and pains and by Saturday I was in such pain and I slept most of the day. Today is Sunday--better, but still falling asleep in the afternoon and going to bed at 9 in pain. 
 Is this chemo related, or do I have a virus? what is other people's experience? thank you.

  My reply to you here:
 Dear ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù
 First of all, I‚Äôm going to take the liberty of answering you on a ‚Äúnew topic line‚Äù for this reason. You will note that the posting to which you replied is due to be removed because it is erroneous and has nothing to do with Ovarian cancer.
  https://csn.cancer.org/comment/1581142#comment-1581142
 It seems usually each week on a Friday that we have ‚Äúadvertisements‚Äù pop up telling us to ‚Äúwatch‚Äù certain shows. They always give some kind of topic that makes us think it is a serious inquiry that needs answering. Then we see the same old garbage. Note that this item has been flagged. That means that this site will remove this particular thread, and I wouldn‚Äôt want your letter to get lost. So I‚Äôm going to answer you on a different thread. 
 While I‚Äôm not taking either of these drugs, I do know that they are both drugs given to treat Ovarian cancer. And so I will give you some links from Chemocare.com that will outline the purpose for each of these drugs. You will note that there are side effects listed for each drug. Constipation is a terrible problem to have‚ÄîI know about that one. My two drugs so far have been Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (Taxol). And so far, they have been effective in reducing the number of tumors to a point that I can have some time in between called ‚ÄúProgression Free Survival.‚Äù That‚Äôs the goal for my Stage IV Ovarian Cancer. When these drugs become less and less effective, there are others that may be recommended, but I‚Äôm not there yet. And depending on my state of health, at the next time I need more treatment, I will have to make a choice as to whether or not I want another treatment if it is going to just extend my life minus the quality factor. 
 Now I don‚Äôt know who might be answering your post, other than me, but I do remembering reading letters from others who have had AVASTIN prescribed. I note that ‚Äúconstipation‚Äù and ‚Äúabdominal pain‚Äù are side effects of Avastin. 
  The info says that while this is not an emergency, if you are exhibiting any of these symptoms that you need to see your doctor. Now the other drug also has side effects which you can read when you access that site, but I chose to highlight the ‚ÄúAVASTIN‚Äù reference since pain and constipation were listed as side effects that more than 30% of patients on this drug may experience. 
 But for your own peace of mind, you should call your oncologist tomorrow, and ask to be seen. Moreover, I hope you can be worked into the schedule and not be ‚Äúput off‚Äù. My oncologist always works me into his schedule, or at least makes arrangements for me to be seen by his nurse, if I am having difficulty and ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù that I need to be seen right away. Hopefully, you will be able to get past this awful period and see some improvement. We all know how awful chemo can make you feel. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to go through this again.

 ‚Äú‚Ä¶Side Effects of Avastin:
 Important things to remember about the side effects of avastin:
 Most people do not experience all of the side effects listed.
 Side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration. 
 Side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.
 There are many options to help minimize or prevent side effects.
 There is no relationship between the presence or severity of side effects and the effectiveness of the medication.
 There is no data as to the frequency of adverse reactions that may be attributed to avastin alone. (In clinical studies avastin was used in combination with other chemotherapy medications).
 The following side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients taking avastin:
 Generalized Weakness
 Pain
 Abdominal pain 
 Nausea & vomiting 
 Poor appetite 
 Constipation 
 Upper respiratory infection 
 Low white blood cell count. (This can put you at increased risk for infection.) 
  Proteinuria (see kidney problems) 
 Nose bleed (see bleeding problems)
 Diarrhea 
 Hair loss 
 Mouth sores 
 Headache‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThe following symptoms require medical attention, but are not an emergency. Contact your health care provider within 24 hours of noticing any of the following:
 Swelling of the feet or ankles. Sudden weight gain.
 Abdominal pain
 Nausea (interferes with ability to eat and unrelieved with prescribed medication).
 Vomiting (vomiting more than 4-5 times in a 24 hour period).
 Diarrhea (4-6 episodes in a 24-hour period).
 Constipation unrelieved by laxative use.
 Coughing up blood.
 Black or tarry stools, or blood in your stools.
 Blood in the urine.
 Mouth sores (painful redness, swelling or ulcers).
 Swelling, redness and/or pain in one leg or arm and not the other.
 Signs of infection such as redness or swelling, pain on swallowing, coughing up mucous, or painful urination.
 Unable to eat or drink for 24 hours or have signs of dehydration: tiredness, thirst, dry mouth, dark and decreased amount of urine, or dizziness.
 Always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms‚Ä¶‚Äù

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/308901/symptoms-and-screening,"Hello everyone,
 I felt it was important to join CSN to post my experience with the hope that I can provide some good and useful information.
 A little bit about me. I am the mom of two young boys (ages 2 and 4). I had my boys at the ages of 45 and 48 (via donor egg). I am now 50. According to the criteria, I am at average risk to get ovarian cancer.
 For the past six months, I have been bloated and most recently, have been urinating frequently. Intermittently, I felt ""twinges"" in my abdominal area but nothing painful.
 I went to my primary care physician to see if it was a urinary tract infection and while I had a few white blood cells in my urine, he was not convinced it was a full blown UTI. I am currently waiting for the culture to come back. Today, I decided to be proactive and called my OBGYN ‚Äì who I have a relationship with ‚Äì and request to come in for a transvaginal ultrasound. She obliged. As it turns out, my ovaries are clear, no cyst or cystic mass. My OBGYN also felt my abdominal area and that was clear as well. The culprit in this situation (so far) is gas.
 What I wanted to share with everyone is that in the waiting stages of these two doctor appointments, I scoured the Internet to learn everything I could about ovarian cancer. Since I had 2 out of the 4 main symptoms mentioned on just about every website (bloating and frequent urination), I was prepared for anything. 
 What makes ovarian cancer so concerning is that it is typically caught at a later stage because the symptoms are pretty vague and could be attributed to many other things. Today, at the appointment with my OBGYN, I asked her why, if a transvaginal ultrasound can detect a cyst or a cystic mass, how come it is not part of an annual or semi-annual exam, like the PAP test? She did not have a definitive answer, but said while it is not part of the annual screen, she thinks it should be. I asked her if I could make it a part of my semi-annual exam (I go semi-annually because of other GYN issues). Her reply was that I could but that the ultrasound would have to be billed separately and that insurance would not cover it. It would be 100% my expense, but she would offer me a discount. I am going to do this from now on. I will give up one latte (or 2) per day and that should cover the cost. I asked about the CA-125 test as a preventative measure, but she said it was not accurate in determining if a mass is present. Equally, as stated on ACS‚Äôs website for the transvaginal (TVUS) ultrasound:
 ‚ÄúTVUS is a test that uses sound waves to look at the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries by putting an ultrasound wand into the vagina. It can help find a mass (tumor) in the ovary, but it can't actually tell if a mass is cancer or benign. When it is used for screening, most of the masses found are not cancer.‚Äù
 In my opinion, the reason why this may not be part of the annual screen is because insurance companies would not want to pay for this type of testing because if they did cover it, they would have to also cover the next step, which is determining if the cyst(s) are cancerous. Let‚Äôs face it, cysts are pretty common and benign. With that said, I am not going to let an insurance company dictate how I am going to be treated medically. I will find the money to pay for two ultrasounds per year. I am so glad I went through this experience and will be even MORE happy if I have been helpful n any way.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/306047/when-is-ovca-actually-diagnosed-how-often-should-ca125-be-done,"Hello everyone,
 I don't know if I have a right to post here as I don't have an official diagnosis of ovarian cancer. That is actually one of my questions - since it cannot be diagnosed until surgery as biopsy is not recommended, is that the only time I will get a diagnosis of OVCA or do people get one sooner?
 I am 39 and BRCA positive (strong family history of breast cancer, so I know lots about that, but no one has had OVCA). I have had regular transvaginal ultrasounds and CA125 tests for about 6-7 years due to my high risk status. My normal CA125 is 15. I've had cysts come and go, none suspicious or stressful.
 I got pregnant late August and my dr sent me for a dating ultrasound (transvaginal). It found everything was fine, including my ovaries. 10 days later, I miscarried and was sent for another transvaginal ultrasound to confirm everything was gone. This one found a 2cm solid, vascular nodule on my right ovary. This led to a CA125 which is 139. I know CA125 can rise during first trimester, but everything I've read is that it should be more in the 50 range at that time.
 I have been having symptoms of OVCA daily for about 2 months, but these overlap a bit with pregnancy symptoms, so I wasn't concerned initially. Predominantly: (1) Now I have daily right-side pelvic pain and it's getting worse. Pain level of a 1-2 last month is now a 3-4. and (2) I feel bloated daily and cannot wear button up pants but have no weight change. Other symptoms come and go (fatigue, constipation, back pain, indigestion).
 I've been referred to gyno/oncology and for an MRI but will not even hear when those appointments will be for a week and likely the appointments will not be for about a month. Should I ask my dr for a repeat CA125 test in the interim? I know serial results are useful, but how far apart should they be taken? Anything else I should be requesting or could be doing while I wait?

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/306909/hormones,"Hello! I am 34 years old. I am an ovarian cancer survivor of almost 12 years now (yay!). I was diagnosed at age 24 with stage 3c. I had a total hysterectomy and did chemo for a year. I am so happy to be cancer free and alive, but my health and mood struggle every day. I went in to menopause quickly and I have no hormones in my body so I am definitely feeling the harsh effects of that as I age. My issues include; Constant exhaustion & low energy, Foggy brained & forgetful, Osteopenia has begun, Anxiety, Depression (I have tried medication and nothing helps), and No sex drive. I know my quality of life is suffering greatly. I am debating on starting hormone therapy. Here is my question....HAS ANYONE OUT THERE MADE THE CHOICE TO START HORMONE THERAPY???
 I know this is not an easy choice to make. I am so afraid the cancer will return if I start hormones!! I have heard mixed things about them. My oncologist thinks I should be safe to take them. But, I have had mixed reactions from Endocrinologists....one has told me ""it should me ok"", and another told me ""no way"". 
 I am so torn on what to do!!!! 
 Can anyone give me some advice please? It will be so greatly appreciated!!!

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/306666/update-surgery-scheduled,"so I met with the gyno-oncologist yesterday and somehow really, truly expected she'd say this was all a false alarm and nothing is likely wrong. I thought she'd offer preventative, elective BSO as I'm BRCA+ and we'd talk about doing it sometime in spring maybe or after I turn 40.
 Instead, she said she's really concerned and does not even consider a BSO to be elective at this point. She thinks it's necessary and only adding a hysterectomy for adenomyosis would be my choice. So, surgery is scheduled for Dec 15 and they are taking out my ovaries, tubes, uterus and cervix.
 She said to there are 3 ways this could go:
 1) they see cancer during the surgery and then it will go from laparascopic to big incision and debulking. If they see something suspicious, but not certainly cancer, they will treat as if it is cancer. This would of course be followed by chemo.
 2) they don't see cancer, so remove what was agreed to laparascopically and send to lab. In 4-6 weeks lab results could come back that there was cancer or precancer there. This would mean another surgery for looking around and debulking followed by chemo.
 3) they don't see cancer and the lab results come back in 4-6 weeks with no cancer or precancer. I heal from this surgery, take HRT for 5-10 years, and am done.
 Obviously, I'm praying for #3 but now realize this will be a lot more waiting. Waiting until surgery. Waiting for lab results. I also realize that I don't think life will ever truly be the same. Even #3 is a bit scary with surgical menopause and it's consequences. I have a history of major healling problems. Every sugery I've ever had took my 4X longer to heal than is considered normal and my scars are always huge and permanently painful.
 I also now need to tell my kids since so far, I've said nothing. I think I will tell them this is preventatitve due to BRCA and cross the cancer bridge with them only if necessary when the time comes.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/306062/concerned-cancer,"Hello all, I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. This is my first time posting in such a forum so please bare with me.
 I am a 29 yo female with a history of severe endometriosis, adenomyosis, and ovarian cysts. I have had 2 laprascopic surgeries to remove endometriosis lesions (2011 and 2014.) After my first laparoscopy I completed 3 months of Depo Lupron injections and became pregnant and delivered a healthy baby boy in 2012. Shortly thereafter I had the Mirena IUD inserted. Endometriosis symptoms returned and became serious enough requiring the second laparoscopy in 2014. I also had a small ovarian cyst (2cm) removed during surgery. GYN then placed me on an oral contraceptive to combat recurrent ovarian cysts.
  Fast forward to May 2016. Pelvic pain has again reached a point where it is unbearable. I am certain I have an ovarian cyst and make an appointment. However this time, the symptoms were much different than I had ever experienced before. I was extremely bloated/distended and looked 6 months pregnant. No frequwncy in my urination, but when I had to go it was URGENT. I could hardly eat, but when I did I felt extremely full after just a few bites. The pain was predominantly on my left side around my ovary, but I was generally uncomfortable all over due to the bloating and gas. Transvag revealed an 8cm complex cyst with septations. I was sent for laparoscopy the same day to have the cyst removed. Dealt mainly with residents and was extremely frustrated with my care. Dr overseeing them had a lot of questions regarding family history with cancer. (Maternal aunt had early onset breast cancer, and several years later passed away from complications related to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. My mother passed away from brain cancer in 2001.) I do not know any paternal family history. Anyways, the cyst was successfully removed and was benign. Aside from surgical complications leading to internal bleeding and an emergency lap the next day to remove blood that had pooled around my pancreas, the first lap was rather uneventful. 
 Sincer about 3 months after the insertion of Mirena, my menses ceased to exist. Fast forward now to July (2months post the May lap's) and out of nowhere I have a ""period."" It only lasted about 3 days and was really just moderate spotting at most. Cramps and pain were unbearable. Repeat in August like clockwork, as if I was having a normal cycle. Same moderate spotting. September comes around and I can FEEL my messes coming at the time of month it did before, horrible cramping, pelvic pain, back pain, change in bowel movements...but menses never comes. Symptoms persist, and feel very similar to early pregnancy. Nauseous, cramps, little to no appetite, feel overfull after eating, etc. Pain is relentless and becomes consistently worse. I make an appt with a GYN. He doesn't say much other than the strings to my IUD still cannot be found (they couldn't back in May either), but paired with my symptoms he is going straight to a laparoscopy to explore, and to remove the IUd surgically. This is the first time I have met his GYN and he was a man of VERY few words. Sent me home with pain medication and lap has been scheduled for Nov 10. He did make one comment during my visit that he reviewed notes from my May lap and that although they did remove the cyst, they ""didn't really remove anything else."" I have no idea what he meant by that .
 Since that visit my pain is persistent and more often than not, much more severe. My ovaries literally feel like they are being squeezed and doused in acid. There's a general dull ache throughout my pelvis. The pain in my back is almost unbearable. A burning dull ache that feels as if it is radiating from somewhere deep within. Pain is worse when moving, or squatting/sitting with my legs up (my son is now 4...there's little time for rest.) A lot of times, for whatever reason, my ovaries hurt worse during urination. I am so miserable that when I do get a break I collapse on a heating pad on the couch and cry.
 I just feel like something is being missed here, and my mind is a mess waiting for surgery and for answers. My appetite is hit or miss but I am never able to eat very much without feeling like I've eaten way too much. I do not have the bloating or distension that I had in May.
 I just feel like I need to talk to real people who have lived/are living what has become a very big fear for me. What are your thoughts? I am so worried that something was missed during my May lap's.",hello all i want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this this is my first time posting in such a forum so please bare with me i am a 29 yo female with a history of severe endometriosis adenomyosis and ovarian cysts i have had 2 laprascopic surgeries to remove endometriosis lesions 2011 and 2014 after my first laparoscopy i completed 3 months of depo lupron injections and became pregnant and delivered a healthy baby boy in 2012 shortly thereafter i had the mirena iud inserted endometriosis symptoms returned and became serious enough requiring the second laparoscopy in 2014 i also had a small ovarian cyst 2cm removed during surgery gyn then placed me on an oral contraceptive to combat recurrent ovarian cysts fast forward to may 2016 pelvic pain has again reached a point where it is unbearable i am certain i have an ovarian cyst and make an appointment however this time the symptoms were much different than i had ever experienced before i was extremely bloateddistended and looked 6 months pregnant no frequwncy in my urination but when i had to go it was urgent i could hardly eat but when i did i felt extremely full after just a few bites the pain was predominantly on my left side around my ovary but i was generally uncomfortable all over due to the bloating and gas transvag revealed an 8cm complex cyst with septations i was sent for laparoscopy the same day to have the cyst removed dealt mainly with residents and was extremely frustrated with my care dr overseeing them had a lot of questions regarding family history with cancer maternal aunt had early onset breast cancer and several years later passed away from complications related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia my mother passed away from brain cancer in 2001 i do not know any paternal family history anyways the cyst was successfully removed and was benign aside from surgical complications leading to internal bleeding and an emergency lap the next day to remove blood that had pooled around my pancreas the first lap was rather uneventful sincer about 3 months after the insertion of mirena my menses ceased to exist fast forward now to july 2months post the may laps and out of nowhere i have a period it only lasted about 3 days and was really just moderate spotting at most cramps and pain were unbearable repeat in august like clockwork as if i was having a normal cycle same moderate spotting september comes around and i can feel my messes coming at the time of month it did before horrible cramping pelvic pain back pain change in bowel movementsbut menses never comes symptoms persist and feel very similar to early pregnancy nauseous cramps little to no appetite feel overfull after eating etc pain is relentless and becomes consistently worse i make an appt with a gyn he doesnt say much other than the strings to my iud still cannot be found they couldnt back in may either but paired with my symptoms he is going straight to a laparoscopy to explore and to remove the iud surgically this is the first time i have met his gyn and he was a man of very few words sent me home with pain medication and lap has been scheduled for nov 10 he did make one comment during my visit that he reviewed notes from my may lap and that although they did remove the cyst they didnt really remove anything else i have no idea what he meant by that since that visit my pain is persistent and more often than not much more severe my ovaries literally feel like they are being squeezed and doused in acid theres a general dull ache throughout my pelvis the pain in my back is almost unbearable a burning dull ache that feels as if it is radiating from somewhere deep within pain is worse when moving or squattingsitting with my legs up my son is now 4theres little time for rest a lot of times for whatever reason my ovaries hurt worse during urination i am so miserable that when i do get a break i collapse on a heating pad on the couch and cry i just feel like something is being missed here and my mind is a mess waiting for surgery and for answers my appetite is hit or miss but i am never able to eat very much without feeling like ive eaten way too much i do not have the bloating or distension that i had in may i just feel like i need to talk to real people who have livedare living what has become a very big fear for me what are your thoughts i am so worried that something was missed during my may laps,"Depo Lupron, Mirena",Yes,High,"extremely bloated/distended, urgent urination, could hardly eat, felt extremely full after just a few bites, generally uncomfortable all over due to bloating and gas, unbearable cramps and pain, pelvic pain, back pain, change in bowel movements",none

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/305843/disability-payment-info-for-ovarian-cancer-stage-iv-patients-that-may-b-helpful-4-n-e-one-to-know-wh,"‚ÄúHello again SUNshine‚Äù
  ""Sandaravalli"" - Referencing your letter for info on how to go about applying for Disability payments~~Not having any experience in applying for Disability payments, I can‚Äôt speak personally. But I think the references I've provided below my name will be a helpful start. And since this is a much-needed benefit for many of our Ovarian Cancer sisters who have been diagnosed with late stage OC, I thought I would just put it on a separate topic. 
  Early on in my life I worked as a Stenographer right out of High School, plus went to college part-time, and of course had to ‚Äúwork in‚Äù dating some handsome males. Well, as time went on, I met and married William. We talked about both of us working. It was left up to me to make the choice. So I chose the best of both worlds I figure. ‚ÄúHe would make the money and I would ‚Äúspend‚Äù it. And guess what, I was one of those women back in the 60‚Äôs who chose to ‚ÄúSTAY HOME AND BAKE COOKIES!‚Äù
  Yes, there were some ‚Äúlean‚Äù times early on. But now I‚Äôm looking at over 50 years accumulation of ‚Äústuff‚Äù and wondering why I thought I ever needed or accumulated all of it. Some days the furniture cries out as I pass by, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm still here. Dust me first!‚Äù I remember the comedienne Phyllis Diller saying, she never dusted. ‚ÄúOnce a year she called the police and reported a robbery. The FBI came over and dusted for fingerprints!‚Äù
  And, of course Erma Bombeck lamented about the things she would do differently if she had her life to live over. And wouldn‚Äôt we all? She wouldn‚Äôt save that big pretty candle, she would burn it before it ‚Äúmelted‚Äù in the closet. So last year I burnt the ‚Äúscented candles‚Äù the grandkids gave me. A cancer diagnosis is a ‚Äúsobering‚Äù experience, and priorities certainly get rearranged, not so much by us, but by IT, does it not? And pretty much all the ‚Äústuff‚Äù of our lives with the exception of loving God and country, our family, and our friends, isn‚Äôt of any lasting value in my opinion. The wonderful memories of helping others is gratifying. 
  And women know that working outside the home and inside the home is surely juggling two jobs. Sometimes when applying for something, I was asked, ‚ÄúDo you work?‚Äù To which I always replied, ‚ÄúDo you mean ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the home?‚Äù Never let it be implied that being a homemaker isn‚Äôt a full-time job in and by itself. So when you‚Äôre diagnosed with Stage IV cancer, how on earth are you supposed to ‚Äúkeep up with your normal routines of life‚Äù when this cancer is pulling you in the opposite direction? Erma also wrote: ‚ÄúI would have gone to bed when I was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if I weren't there for the day.‚Äù 
  In those days jobs were available and women did have choices. I‚Äôve been happily married to the same man for the last 54 years now. We‚Äôve grown closer together through the ‚Äútrials of life‚Äù that naturally occur to all who dwell on Planet Earth. Moreover, I was his caregiver in the world of Esophageal Cancer, and now he is mine. God‚Äôs still good. I‚Äôve got lots to be thankful for, including the fact that I am ‚Äúnot alone‚Äù even though my present PET scan last week reveals that my cancer has advanced ‚Äúconsiderably.‚Äù But I move on, confident that my times are in the hands of the Lord. 
  So my advice to you (although you didn‚Äôt ask for it) is make the most of moment of each day you have, and with Stage IV, why try to ‚Äúwork in further employment‚Äù if you can work out anything else? This cancer is ‚Äúdebilitating‚Äù and it does put a ‚Äúcrimp in our future‚Äù and how we want to spend the rest of our days. I‚Äôm going to have to make some choices this week, none of which I wish to make, but the most I, as a realist, can pray for is to have long periods of ‚Äúprogression free time‚Äù (PFS) between the traditional treatments now available to Stage IV Ovarian Cancer patients. Last time I checked, there is no Stage V!
  So my prayer for you would be that you are quickly able to get some help with your finances, because Ovarian Cancer Stage IV definitely disables us. You should not have to jump through hoops and get in a ‚Äúred-tape entanglement‚Äù to receive something that you are definitely qualified for. Think of how many people are ripping off the system, who really are able to work, but have managed to scam the government.
  I hope for both you and me that we will make the wisest choice of those treatments presented to us for ‚Äúoptions‚Äù. All of us who ‚Äúlive in the OC‚Äù world want to enjoy a good quality of life so we can spend it with those we love the most. 
  Wishing you all success,
  Loretta ~ also Stage IV OC

  April 30, 2015- Written by guest blogger Deanna Power‚Ä¶
  How to Medically Qualify with Ovarian Cancer
 The SSA evaluates all applicants with a medical guide called the Blue Book, which has listings for various conditions, symptoms, and disability benefit qualifications‚Ä¶More severe forms of ovarian cancer that also have distant metastases or are inoperable (a physician‚Äôs opinion that surgery will not be beneficial) or unresectable (the cancer is still present after surgery). If your ovarian cancer has progressed this far, it is listed on the SSA‚Äôs Compassionate Allowances List (CAL). The CAL is a list of conditions that are eligible for almost immediate approval, because the symptoms are so serious that patients can‚Äôt wait the one to two years of a normal SSD approval. Applicants with inoperable ovarian cancer or distant metastases can expect to be approved in as little as 10 days‚Ä¶‚Äù

  (My personal note: This article was last updated in 2008 and still applicable going forward. It would seem that someone would have ‚Äúupdated‚Äù it since then. However, if you reference it, you will quickly be told if changes have been made. But when possible, I like to see when the article in question was last reviewed by someone responsible and placed a more recent date than one some 8 years ago. But it would seem if OC patients were eligible then, it would certainly be true today. )

  Disability Evaluation Under Social Security
  ‚ÄúSocial Security Disability Planner for applying for disability benefits online‚Ä¶
  Social Security representatives in the field offices usually obtain applications for disability benefits in person, by telephone, by mail, or by filing online. The application and related forms ask for a description of the claimant‚Äôs impairment (s), treatment sources, and other information that relates to the alleged disability. (The ""claimant"" is the person who is requesting disability benefits.)‚Ä¶‚Äù
  ___________________________________________________
  4. https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/
  ‚Äú‚Ä¶The disability planner will help you find out:
  How you can qualify and apply for benefits,
 What happens if your application is approved,
 Who can receive benefits on your earnings record,
 What you need to know about receiving disability benefits, and
 When Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries.
  Disability and SSI
  We pay disability benefits under two programs:
  The Social Security disability insurance program pays benefits to you and certain family members if you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes.
  Your adult child also may qualify for benefits on your earnings record if he or she has a disability that started before age 22.
  The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources.
  For most people, the medical requirements for disability payments are the same under both programs and disability is determined by the same process.
  Whether you apply for Social Security or SSI disability, we ask you for information about your medical condition, work and education history to help us decide if you are disabled under our rules.
  Most of the information in this planner is about Social Security disability benefits. Links to additional information about SSI can be found on ""What Is Supplemental Security Income?""

  ‚ÄúApplying for Social Security Disability Benefits with Ovarian Cancer
  According to the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, there are nearly 22,000 new cases of Ovarian Cancer diagnosed in the US every year. It is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death for women. Because Ovarian Cancer is such a serious disease, many women are unable to work while receiving cancer treatments. Due to this hardship, the Social Security Administration (SSA) offers financial benefits for families in need.
  What Type of Benefits Could I Receive?
  There are two forms of disability benefits. Medical eligibility is the same for both types, but each has its own technical qualifications.
  The first is known as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). SSDI is only available for adult women who have worked throughout their lives and paid Social Security taxes, or are working part-time and are earning less than $1,090 per month. Younger applicants will be expected to have worked less than older applicants. You typically must have worked for five of the past 10 years to qualify for SSDI, but again, this may not apply to young women. If you are, for example, a mother who took 10 years off work to raise a family, you will not qualify for SSDI. SSDI applicants are eligible for Medicare two years after the onset of their cancer.
  The second form of disability benefits is Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. SSI is available for women of all ages, but there are strict financial limitations for SSI applicants. If you have an income-earning spouse, if you are working part-time, or if you have more than $2,000 saved, you will not qualify for SSI. Most applicants who are approved for SSI benefits are enrolled in Medicaid. Only a handful of states have a separate eligibility standard for Medicaid. Be sure to check with your local Social Security office to see if you need to file any additional paperwork for Medicaid. Some women can qualify for both SSI and SSDI if their financial need is strong enough AND they have a recent work history, but most will only qualify for one form of disability benefits. 
  What About Benefits for my Family?
  If you are approved for SSDI benefits only, your family will be eligible for additional benefits on your behalf. The two eligible parties would be your children and your spouse. Your children can qualify for up to 50% of your benefits if they‚Äôre under the age of 18 OR they‚Äôre 19 and still in high school, if they‚Äôre unmarried, and they are your biological child, adoptive child, or stepchild. Your spouse can also qualify for up to 50% of your benefits if you share the care for your child under age 16. Keep in mind that you can only receive up to 180% of your monthly payment, so if you have a large family, not all members will receive 50% of your payment.
  How Do I Qualify Medically with Ovarian Cancer?
  When you apply for disability benefits for Ovarian Cancer, the SSA will compare your cancer to its listing in the Blue Book. The Blue Book is a medical guide that lists how severe a disability must be to qualify for benefits.
  Ovarian Cancer is listed in Section 13.23--Cancers of the female genital tract. There are two ways to qualify with Ovarian Cancer:
  1. Your Ovarian Cancer is a non germ-cell cancer with one of the following:
  ¬∑ Extension of the cancer beyond your pelvis, such as your bowels.
 ¬∑ Your cancer has spread beyond regional lymph nodes.
  ¬∑ Your cancer has returned despite a round of anticancer treatment.
  2. Your Ovarian Cancer is germ cell and it returned despite a round of anticancer treatment.
 Speak with your doctor to find out if your Ovarian Cancer has progressed far enough to qualify for disability benefits. Ovarian Cancer will often qualify at Stage IIB, where it has grown into nearby pelvic organs. It will almost always qualify at Stage III and beyond.
  Compassionate Allowances and Disability Benefits
  Some disabilities, such as late-stage Ovarian Cancer, are clearly disabling. For cases like these, the SSA will speed up the application process. It will usually take around 4-5 months to get approved for disability benefits. Women who qualify for a Compassionate Allowance can expect to be approved in as little as 10 days. You do not need to send in a separate application to qualify for a Compassionate Allowance. The SSA will simply approve your claim quickly. If one of the following is met, you will likely qualify for a Compassionate Allowance:
  1. Your Ovarian Cancer is inoperable.
  2. Your Ovarian Cancer has spread to distant organs.
  3. Your Ovarian Cancer has returned despite a round of initial treatment.
  How to Apply for Benefits
  Every woman applying for Social Security disability benefits should first visit the SSA‚Äôs website at www.ssa.gov and go through their Adult Disability Starter Kit. It will outline exactly what you need to apply, from tax forms to medical records. SSDI applicants can complete the entire application online, while SSI applicants need to schedule an appointment at their local SSA office.

  _______________________End of references_____________________",hello again sunshine sandaravalli referencing your letter for info on how to go about applying for disability paymentsnot having any experience in applying for disability payments i cant speak personally but i think the references ive provided below my name will be a helpful start and since this is a muchneeded benefit for many of our ovarian cancer sisters who have been diagnosed with late stage oc i thought i would just put it on a separate topic early on in my life i worked as a stenographer right out of high school plus went to college parttime and of course had to work in dating some handsome males well as time went on i met and married william we talked about both of us working it was left up to me to make the choice so i chose the best of both worlds i figure he would make the money and i would spend it and guess what i was one of those women back in the 60s who chose to stay home and bake cookies yes there were some lean times early on but now im looking at over 50 years accumulation of stuff and wondering why i thought i ever needed or accumulated all of it some days the furniture cries out as i pass by hey im still here dust me first i remember the comedienne phyllis diller saying she never dusted once a year she called the police and reported a robbery the fbi came over and dusted for fingerprints and of course erma bombeck lamented about the things she would do differently if she had her life to live over and wouldnt we all she wouldnt save that big pretty candle she would burn it before it melted in the closet so last year i burnt the scented candles the grandkids gave me a cancer diagnosis is a sobering experience and priorities certainly get rearranged not so much by us but by it does it not and pretty much all the stuff of our lives with the exception of loving god and country our family and our friends isnt of any lasting value in my opinion the wonderful memories of helping others is gratifying and women know that working outside the home and inside the home is surely juggling two jobs sometimes when applying for something i was asked do you work to which i always replied do you mean outside the home never let it be implied that being a homemaker isnt a fulltime job in and by itself so when youre diagnosed with stage iv cancer how on earth are you supposed to keep up with your normal routines of life when this cancer is pulling you in the opposite direction erma also wrote i would have gone to bed when i was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if i werent there for the day in those days jobs were available and women did have choices ive been happily married to the same man for the last 54 years now weve grown closer together through the trials of life that naturally occur to all who dwell on planet earth moreover i was his caregiver in the world of esophageal cancer and now he is mine gods still good ive got lots to be thankful for including the fact that i am not alone even though my present pet scan last week reveals that my cancer has advanced considerably but i move on confident that my times are in the hands of the lord so my advice to you although you didnt ask for it is make the most of moment of each day you have and with stage iv why try to work in further employment if you can work out anything else this cancer is debilitating and it does put a crimp in our future and how we want to spend the rest of our days im going to have to make some choices this week none of which i wish to make but the most i as a realist can pray for is to have long periods of progression free time pfs between the traditional treatments now available to stage iv ovarian cancer patients last time i checked there is no stage v so my prayer for you would be that you are quickly able to get some help with your finances because ovarian cancer stage iv definitely disables us you should not have to jump through hoops and get in a redtape entanglement to receive something that you are definitely qualified for think of how many people are ripping off the system who really are able to work but have managed to scam the government i hope for both you and me that we will make the wisest choice of those treatments presented to us for options all of us who live in the oc world want to enjoy a good quality of life so we can spend it with those we love the most wishing you all success loretta also stage iv oc _____________________________________________ ps you might want to start off viewing

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/305334/stage-4-ovarian-cancer-scared-for-my-mom,"My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer at 52 years old about a year and a half ago. After surgery (hysterectomy) and chemo (taxol) she improved by almost 95% Until a couple of months ago... her oncologyst put her on Cytoxin and she complained of pains and breathing problems but nothing was done. Her leg swelled 2x normal size and the tumors were interferring with the function of one of her kidneys. She had a nephrostomy and a leg stint put in. Her doctor, regarding the growing tumors, wanted to keep her on cytoxin.
  Then, earlier this week, i took her to the ER because she was in a lot of pain. A CT scan was performed and the ER doctors found a 7cm tumor on her liver as well as particules in her lungs. Now, she is at stage 4b. The ER doctor told her that she is dying and that there is nothing that can be done. Her oncologist was told the news and we went in to see him the next day. He seems to think that the ER doctors were handing us a line. ""that's not true, we'll switch chemos.""And schedules us an appointment a week ahead.
  A couple days go by and she got worse. Took her back to the ER. A different doctor who treated her told her the same thing, ""you're dying"" and encouraged her to go into hospice. While i appreciate their honesty (which is all i want - an honest, blunt answer), i am angry that they are not giving us any hope at all and encouraging her to just DIE. I know that her oncologist is not telling it like it is, he's sugar coating this. It is really starting to bother me. It all is. My mother is getting scared and it seems like she is losing hope. I understand.. She is in a lot of pain.But at the same time she is still willing to fight. I asked her last night what she wanted. She still wants to try. She even talked about clinical trials.
 Right now she is still in the hospital. She was having difficulties breathing so she had fluid drained from her lungs and her stomach. She constantly vomits so she can't take her pain meds orally or eat (she'ss take a few bites of something though). She is in severe back and abdominal pain... i don't know what to do. The IV pain meds only do so much. Her oncologist is on vacation until tomorrow, so we have not spoken to him since earlier this week.
  A part of me wants to be selfish and make her stick it out - give it one more try with everything we've got - with a different chemo and maybe some more surgery, radiation?... but another part of me wants to let her decide what she wants to do on her own. I feel like the only reason she wants to fight is because of me. It's what i want her to do. It is hard to see her in the condition she is in, so i am torn between it all. Does anyone have any advice? I am really lost, scared, and confused. My mom is my everything... my best friend. I don't want to lose my mom and i don't want her to suffer, but i know that the cancer will win, when... i don't know. 
 It is starting to get bad. I can tell that there is still some fight in her, but it looks like she is slowly giving up. Is it too late? Can we prolong her life... just a little longer while having a decent quality of life? Whatever she decides, i will be there. I just want to know if we/she do end up deciding to give it another shot, what are the chances? Anyone going through or have gone through this? How did everything turn out? How much longer was their life prologned? What was their quality of life? I would ask her oncologist but i don't feel that he is being honest with us. I really want to hear stories about anything similar to what she is going through, whether they are good or bad. I just want to know what to possibly expect, while i know everyone is different, it is still in a sense, comforting to know what MAY happen, good or bad.
  Thank you

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/305150/just-a-personal-chat-with-pat-hope-heart-checkup-will-turn-out-ok,"Good afternoon Pat:
 I‚Äôm glad ‚ÄúKIKZ‚Äù was able to give you a more direct and helpful answer to your heart problem. So it seems that it might only be an ‚Äúon and off‚Äù thing relative to your cancer diagnosis. I see she‚Äôs been here since 2010. That‚Äôs encouraging, although we know that there are lots of ‚Äúrough patches‚Äù along the road, and yet thankful to find some ‚Äúsmooth spots‚Äù along the way. As for your tiredness, my energy has never been the same since my diagnosis, and I don‚Äôt expect to get it back. With ongoing cancer, even when we‚Äôre not actively taking chemo, we just don‚Äôt ‚Äúbounce back.‚Äù Lest we also remember that with age, our minds seem to be forever ‚Äúyoung‚Äù while our ‚Äúbody‚Äù says ‚ÄúOh Yeah?‚Äù But I‚Äôm thankful that every day is not a ‚Äúdrag!‚Äù 
  You ask how I‚Äôm doing. Well, for one thing, I did a good thing. I took the plunge and went to the local beauty shop and got a permanent in my hair that had grown a ‚Äúwhopping 3 to 4 inches‚Äù in a YEAR! That‚Äôs a bit on the slow side. And it seemed to grow more in some places than in others! I read some pros and cons about when to get a perm on ‚Äúnew hair after chemo treatments‚Äù and found that it was 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. I talked to my doctor and nurse, and they agreed, ‚ÄúGo for it!‚Äù So I did, and the hair did not ‚Äúfall out!‚Äù So I ‚Äúlook‚Äù more like a healthy person even though my inner workings remain in somewhat disarray. 
  Also, I just went to the eye surgeon yesterday, and had laser surgery on my right eye. So this week requires a maintenance schedule‚Äîputting 5 different kinds of drops in my eye 4X a day. That takes some doing, but so far things are going well. And if this one is successful, and I think it will be, I will be having the left eye worked on next week. The cataracts had gotten so bad that my prescription eye glasses were not serving the purpose. They‚Äôve been ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù for a long time, but way back the eye doctor said it‚Äôs not a question of when they are ‚Äúripe‚Äù. It‚Äôs a question of when your vision becomes impaired to the point that it becomes a problem. But I can‚Äôt complain, I have eyes and I can see. The ability to see is something we can easily take for granted until one day we start to have eyesight problems. So in short, it seems that none of us were created with parts that were guaranteed to last forever, were we? If so, Adam and Eve would still be around. Now as for their being happily married in today‚Äôs chaotic world‚Äîwell that‚Äôs another whole discussion. (LOL) 
 You know I think of you often and just mention your name in prayer because God knows exactly how you feel. He alone can give you the peace that you and I need to cope with an Ovarian cancer from day to day. Most likely you, like me, have a calendar filled with doctor appointments. But I have to say, ‚ÄúThank God I‚Äôve got a doctor that I trust to listen to me, and try to help me.‚Äù I‚Äôve had a couple of x-rays lately to keep a watch on the Pleural Effusion in my chest. So far the doctor doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough to drain. And with Cytoreductive Surgery, I‚Äôm making a lot more trips to the bathroom because my bowels won‚Äôt adhere to my schedule. Oh no, they interrupt me at all times of the day and sometimes nights as well. But now I‚Äôve come to realize that it‚Äôs a byproduct of having one‚Äôs intestines resected. Yes, it‚Äôs aggravating, but just have to say, ‚ÄúWell thank God my bowels are moving instead of dealing with blocked intestines.‚Äù I was on the verge of that back in June of 2015. It was an excruciating pain akin to childbirth. Most mothers probably still remember that pain. 
  And as for your fatigue, if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre just going to have to get used to it. When I step in the shower, I have to do so ever so carefully, because I am not as strong as I was BC (Before Cancer). I remember a time when I was so weak during the chemo treatments that I had to ride in a wheelchair when going down the halls at the Oncology Lab. At home, I was so weak, I had to use a shower chair in order to get a shower. And so nowadays, I say ‚ÄúThank God I can stand!‚Äù But with cancer, we never know what to expect, and it really is a day-to-day coping mechanism that we have to employ to stay sane, and keep a positive attitude. Yes, some days are much more worrisome than others. But we have to weigh the ‚Äúgood with the bad‚Äù and count our blessings. After all, there really are others who are worse off than me. 
  In Sunday school, Sunday, one of our classmates asked prayer for his cousin who has just now had his second leg amputated at the knee due to diabetes. So I thought to myself, ‚ÄúMy soul what if I had both my legs cut off at the knee? I think I‚Äôm at a disadvantage now, what if I couldn‚Äôt walk on my own power. And when I have a new unexplainable pain somewhere, just as you do now, ‚ÄúI have to have a talk with myself, and say, ‚ÄúOkay Loretta are you going to dwell on this all day today?‚Äù For a moment, ‚ÄúOld lady panic‚Äù tries to worm her way in and ruin the day.‚Äù That‚Äôs a bummer. So it‚Äôs my choice, let her steal the good things I have going for me, or just make a note on the calendar, and if it persists, call my doctor? We have to ‚Äúfight our fears‚Äù or they can consume us. So I have a few moments of diagnosing my own pains and making notes for my eventual obituary. But then I think of all the things that are good about this day, and I decide, ‚ÄúNope this ain‚Äôt the day I‚Äôm gonna‚Äô throw in the towel.‚Äù 
  And is so often the case, when I do go to a doctor‚Äôs office or out shopping in the stores, I‚Äôm met folks who always smile and say, ‚ÄúHi how are you?‚Äù You know in the South, we often smile and say Hi to people we pass on the street. Now I know that ‚Äúa High-how-are-you greeting is merely a formality in most cases. Most often, they don‚Äôt really expect an answer. But very often, I smile and say, ‚ÄúWell you know for a Stage IV Terminal Ovarian Cancer, I‚Äôm doing JUST FINE!‚Äù 
  Lastly, my dear mama gave me a plaque a long time ago. It reads: ‚ÄúBEFORE YOU GO TO BED, GIVE YOUR TROUBLES TO GOD. HE‚ÄôLL BE UP ALL NIGHT ANYWAY! 
  What better advice could she have given me? So when I think of you, I say, ‚ÄúLord be near to Pat, comfort her and give her wisdom to know what to do.‚Äù 
  May both of us give our troubles to the Lord, He‚Äôs awake 24/7! And with that, I just told my husband, ""You know what I want? I want to go to Krispy Kreme and get a dozen donuts, fresh off the cooker."" He said, ""Let's go!"" So I'll ""run down"" and then ""waddle home."" Thank God I still have a good appetite.
  Love Loretta",good afternoon pat im glad kikz was able to give you a more direct and helpful answer to your heart problem so it seems that it might only be an on and off thing relative to your cancer diagnosis i see shes been here since 2010 thats encouraging although we know that there are lots of rough patches along the road and yet thankful to find some smooth spots along the way as for your tiredness my energy has never been the same since my diagnosis and i dont expect to get it back with ongoing cancer even when were not actively taking chemo we just dont bounce back lest we also remember that with age our minds seem to be forever young while our body says oh yeah but im thankful that every day is not a drag you ask how im doing well for one thing i did a good thing i took the plunge and went to the local beauty shop and got a permanent in my hair that had grown a whopping 3 to 4 inches in a year thats a bit on the slow side and it seemed to grow more in some places than in others i read some pros and cons about when to get a perm on new hair after chemo treatments and found that it was 6 of one and half a dozen of the other i talked to my doctor and nurse and they agreed go for it so i did and the hair did not fall out so i look more like a healthy person even though my inner workings remain in somewhat disarray also i just went to the eye surgeon yesterday and had laser surgery on my right eye so this week requires a maintenance scheduleputting 5 different kinds of drops in my eye 4x a day that takes some doing but so far things are going well and if this one is successful and i think it will be i will be having the left eye worked on next week the cataracts had gotten so bad that my prescription eye glasses were not serving the purpose theyve been growing for a long time but way back the eye doctor said its not a question of when they are ripe its a question of when your vision becomes impaired to the point that it becomes a problem but i cant complain i have eyes and i can see the ability to see is something we can easily take for granted until one day we start to have eyesight problems so in short it seems that none of us were created with parts that were guaranteed to last forever were we if so adam and eve would still be around now as for their being happily married in todays chaotic worldwell thats another whole discussion lol you know i think of you often and just mention your name in prayer because god knows exactly how you feel he alone can give you the peace that you and i need to cope with an ovarian cancer from day to day most likely you like me have a calendar filled with doctor appointments but i have to say thank god ive got a doctor that i trust to listen to me and try to help me ive had a couple of xrays lately to keep a watch on the pleural effusion in my chest so far the doctor doesnt think its enough to drain and with cytoreductive surgery im making a lot more trips to the bathroom because my bowels wont adhere to my schedule oh no they interrupt me at all times of the day and sometimes nights as well but now ive come to realize that its a byproduct of having ones intestines resected yes its aggravating but just have to say well thank god my bowels are moving instead of dealing with blocked intestines i was on the verge of that back in june of 2015 it was an excruciating pain akin to childbirth most mothers probably still remember that pain and as for your fatigue if youre like me youre just going to have to get used to it when i step in the shower i have to do so ever so carefully because i am not as strong as i was bc before cancer i remember a time when i was so weak during the chemo treatments that i had to ride in a wheelchair when going down the halls at the oncology lab at home i was so weak i had to use a shower chair in order to get a shower and so nowadays i say thank god i can stand but with cancer we never know what to expect and it really is a daytoday coping mechanism that we have to employ to stay sane and keep a positive attitude yes some days are much more worrisome than others but we have to weigh the good with the bad and count our blessings after all there really are others who are worse off than me in sunday school sunday one of our classmates asked prayer for his cousin who has just now had his second leg amputated at the knee due to diabetes so i thought to myself my soul what if i had both my legs cut off at the knee i think im at a disadvantage now what if i couldnt walk on my own power and when i have a new unexplainable pain somewhere just as you do now i have to have a talk with myself and say okay loretta are you going to dwell on this all day today for a moment old lady panic tries to worm her way in and ruin the day thats a bummer so its my choice let her steal the good things i have going for me or just make a note on the calendar and if it persists call my doctor we have to fight our fears or they can consume us so i have a few moments of diagnosing my own pains and making notes for my eventual obituary but then i think of all the things that are good about this day and i decide nope this aint the day im gonna throw in the towel and is so often the case when i do go to a doctors office or out shopping in the stores im met folks who always smile and say hi how are you you know in the south we often smile and say hi to people we pass on the street now i know that a highhowareyou greeting is merely a formality in most cases most often they dont really expect an answer but very often i smile and say well you know for a stage iv terminal ovarian cancer im doing just fine lastly my dear mama gave me a plaque a long time ago it reads before you go to bed give your troubles to god hell be up all night anyway what better advice could she have given me so when i think of you i say lord be near to pat comfort her and give her wisdom to know what to do may both of us give our troubles to the lord hes awake 247 and with that i just told my husband you know what i want i want to go to krispy kreme and get a dozen donuts fresh off the cooker he said lets go so ill run down and then waddle home thank god i still have a good appetite love loretta,not mentioned,Yes,Moderate,"tiredness, weakness, excruciating pain, aggravating bowel issues",none

My oncologist ordered a pet scan, because my CA-125 was 91 at my first post-cancer appointment (it was going down from treatment). Anyway, I had my pet scan on Friday. I was told that the radiologist would read the scan on Friday, and my doctor would have the report Monday. I called today, and got the nurses answering machine and left a message. I have not received a phone call. When I was first diagnosed in February, my oncologist called with biopsy results on a Tuesday night as soon as he got the results. Should I assume that my scan was clear, because I have not heard? The anxiety has been really hard on me the last few days. It's monstronous. Thoughts?

Treated with the standard frontline chemo and was NED after the debulking surgery from 1/2015 through 7/2016. She started having balance issues and trouble writing July 2016. Her oncologists thought maybe a small stroke but did a CT scan of her brain. Many, many small mets to her brain and 4-5 ones that were quite visible on the scan, mostly in the left side.
 Whole brain therapy (WBRT) was given immediately, now she is quite fatigued, of course bloated from the steroids, loss of hair, very sleepy but isn't sleeping well (although better since she started a small dose of benadryl to help with that). She is extremely weak but upbeat so far. Weaning off the steroids is the current issue. Some very small minor seizures while tapering gave her a bit of a backslide there. Still on 12 mgs of DEX a day. Her last CA-125 was 17. No higher than 26 when the mets were discovered.
 We believe she will have a followup scan in the next few weeks so our fingers are crossed that the tumors have either disappeared or limited to 2 or 3 that can be gamma knifed or better!

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/303764/protein-facts-reply-to-bigjohnaz,"Hello to all my Ovarian cancer friends: 
 BigJohnAZ had given us an update on his wife, Michele, and her chemo treatments. He didn't get a quick response and wondered if many women were on here. So I gave him different reasons why everyone who reads these letters, actually may not answer on line. He was asking about protein. It occurred to me that the links I intended to send to him would be good info for anybody that is ""tired"" and in need of enough energy to ""get out of bed!"" Chemotherapy laid me low, and I've been through two different chemo regimens as well as Cytoreductive Surgery. So here's my answer to John, and feel free to open his mail and read it!

 An answer to BigJohnAZ -
  http://csn.cancer.org/node/303397#comment-form - New CA125 numbers UPDATE
  ‚ÄúDear John‚Äù
  Your comment, ‚ÄúI really thought there would be more opinions on the matter. Maybe there are just not many on this page anymore????‚Äù I think all the women on this page, both the non-responders and responders, are keenly interested in knowing more about their own cancer, and also knowing how other women are tolerating their own treatments. They want to know if there are any ‚Äúsecrets to survival‚Äù that can be shared. They want to compare their physicians to other women‚Äôs physicians, and see if there are any additional treatments that they could benefit from. And then there are others who are like ‚Äúpeeping toms‚Äù‚Äîthey want to see what‚Äôs going on, but they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúenter‚Äù into any discussions with others. Some women don‚Äôt have the ability to put their thoughts down on paper, as do others. But they‚Äôre smart. Lastly, they are a ‚Äúcompassionate lot!‚Äù
  Actually I‚Äôve not followed this board as long as some, although I‚Äôm totally familiar with cancer, both as a caregiver to my husband when he was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer, Stage III. That is another rare cancer with only an estimated 17% to ever see the 5-year survival mark, let alone 14 years and so we cherish our days together. Recurrence is always a possibility. And then we had a role reversal, and in 2012, I became the Stage IV cancer patient, and he became the caregiver. So you could say, we‚Äôve known the worst and the best of both worlds. 
  Everyone on here no doubt knows that the Stage IV Ovarian Cancer patients can have Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS), but it is not intended to be curative. Rather it is specifically intended to remove as many ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù organs as possible, to prevent further metastasis to those places, as well as to remove some of the cancer already present as well. We are given ‚Äúpalliative treatments‚Äù intended to give us prolonged periods of ‚Äúprogression free survival‚Äù (PFS). So there are multiple reasons as to why you might not receive a ‚ÄúJohnny-on-the-spot‚Äù response right away. Might I suggest that there are probably many more ‚Äúreaders‚Äù than there are ‚Äúresponders/posters‚Äù on this ‚Äúpage‚Äù and for good reason.
 My cancer sisters here are in different stages of Ovarian cancer. And believe me, some of them are ‚Äústuck in a permanent funk‚Äù, unable to extricate themselves. They somehow imagine that no one else is suffering like they are, and no one will ever convince them otherwise. They are suffering from emotional distress, and severely depressed. Others are in great physical pain, drained of energy and possess little hope that things will ever get better.
  Others are in chemotherapy treatments and being zapped of their last ounce of energy. Some are just emerging from the Operating room, and wondering ‚Äúwhat just happened? They weren‚Äôt feeling this bad when they went into the Operating Room. They're wondering if they are ever going to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again?
  Still others are in dire financial straits and needing more treatment than they can afford. Some are facing the loss of their jobs, or wondering if they will ever be able to return to work. 
  And still others have doctors who aren‚Äôt that compassionate or ‚Äúopen‚Äù with them. Yet still others have no husband to help care for them like you care for Michele, and my husband cares for me. 
 More than one woman on this site is lonely. They‚Äôre facing an uncertain future, and ‚Äúhanging on by a thread‚Äù with only a glimmer of hope that some ‚Äúcure can suddenly be announced‚Äù that will change their world for the better. They feel like they are walking on the ‚Äúhigh wire‚Äù with ‚Äúno net underneath.‚Äù . 
  Others have been told that there is ‚Äúnothing else that we can do for you. Go home and get your house in order.‚Äù For some that means, writing that will, saying goodbyes to those you love dearly, praying to God that you can find someone who will care for your very young children. In some instances others are wondering who will take care of their aged parents who suffer from dementia. They had promised their parents that they would ""take care of them"". Now they find themselves looking for someone to take care of them!
 For some it means making amends to those with whom they‚Äôve been estranged over some trivial matter. Most importantly in my own life is being able to have that one-on-one spiritual walk and talk with God Himself every hour of the day and making sure my ‚Äúspiritual house‚Äù is in order. And also waking up to see the sun rise another day and enjoy family, friends, and helping others along the way. 
  I thought I would just give you an answer to your comment about maybe not many are on this site. But you also asked a question about protein, and it is very important. So rather than ‚Äúspoon feed‚Äù each patient, I find that giving them a reference point that they can make their own is sufficient. You know they say, ‚ÄúGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime!‚Äù With that in mind, these links might be helpful for you so that you can ‚Äúcook‚Äù up a variety of dishes for Michele that will be both delicious and protein-enriched all at the same time. So below my name are several references to sources of protein and its importance to our system.
  Personally, my husband always made me a thick milk-shake every day with at least one scoop of whey isolate, (= 30 grams of protein in each scoop) and usually used ‚ÄúBoost‚Äù (another protein liquid) to make the ice cream just thick enough so that I could eat it with a spoon. He also broke up a Butterfinger candy bar and put that in there together with a big tablespoon of Peanut Butter. I wanted to have at least 60 grams of protein in my diet every day. I usually ate ‚Äúcheese eggs‚Äù and bacon for breakfast. I don‚Äôt eat a lot of bread, but I‚Äôm not going to give up sugar simply because I like to cook all kinds of pie, cakes, homemade rolls and especially my family loves Macaroni and Cheese, made with Velveeta cheese and buttered bread crumbs on top. I actually didn‚Äôt have that much of an appetite but I ate at regular times each day and kept account of all that I did eat during the times I was in chemotherapy. 
  By the way, I too, was once able to ‚Äújump over skyscrapers and leap tall buildings in a single bound‚Äù like Superman. I was a cheerleader in high school and loved every minute of it. I really didn‚Äôt understand a lot about football and really didn‚Äôt know who even had the ball till the last man down, got back up and I could see ‚Äúwho had the ball!‚Äù And how I ever jumped 2 feet off the ground while arching my body in a ‚Äúbackward C‚Äù is beyond me. Now I consider it a major ""feat"" just to touch my toes! Now at age 77, I mostly just jump for joy these days. I couldn't begin to walk 2 miles a day, like Michele. However, at age 48, I was raising my second set of children, 3 boys and a girl, and believe me they kept me ""jumping"" all day long. 
 So kudos to the both of you. Keep up those 2-mile hikes, and they‚Äôll have to change your name to ‚ÄúLittle John‚Äù. And I did look up the cheerleading squad for the Kansas City Chiefs. I doubt that Michele‚Äôs picture is in this group, but that was quite an achievement! 
  So ‚Äúread up and eat up‚Äù and enjoy each day. By the way, I love to cook and ‚ÄúThe Pioneer Woman‚Äù is my favorite of the cooking shows on TV. Here‚Äôs that link: http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/
  There are step by step videos as well as recipes. She, like I, makes food ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù. Now I don‚Äôt know where that expression came from, but it means ‚Äúmake it yourself instead of getting it out of a box, or just opening a can.‚Äù Of course, during chemo there might not be as much energy or appetite to do a big amount of cooking.

  The Top 10 High Protein Foods - Clear and Detailed Information for Your Best Protein Sources
  Protein is a macro nutrient necessary for the proper growth and function of the human body. There is considerable debate over the amount of protein a person needs to consume per day, the current recommended daily intake (RDI) for protein is 46 grams for women aged 19-70, and 56 grams for men aged 19-70. Any excess protein is turned into energy by the body, and it is controversial whether this excess protein causes a strain on the liver. A deficiency in protein leads to muscle atrophy, and impaired functioning of the human body in general. High protein foods include meat, fish, cheese, tofu, beans, lentils, yogurt, eggs, nuts, and seeds. Below is a list of foods with the highest protein to calorie ratio, for more information, see the sections on protein dense foods, other protein rich foods, low calorie high protein snacks, and protein isolates.

  5. http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/proteins/incomplete-vs-complete-proteins.html
 While all proteins you eat contribute to meeting your daily protein requirements, some proteins are better utilized by your body than others. Consuming complete protein in your diet is often beneficial, but it's not entirely necessary. Figuring out how to get the right balance proteins in your diet will help ensure you meet your body's needs.
  How They Differ
  The main difference between complete and incomplete proteins is that complete proteins contain all essential amino acids your body requires daily, and incomplete proteins only contain some essential amino acids. Your body breaks down the proteins you eat into amino acids, which build and repair tissues in your body, help digest food, provide energy, and perform numerous other body functions. Essential amino acids are also necessary for proper growth in children. Because complete proteins contain all essential amino acids, they are often referred to as high-quality proteins and easily utilized by your body.
  Sources of Complete Protein
  Animal sources of protein are complete proteins, and some plant foods contain all essential amino acids. Sources of complete animal proteins include milk, yogurt, cheese, meat, poultry, fish, seafood and eggs. Soy protein is a plant-based source of high-quality, complete protein. Grains that contain all essential amino acidsand are complete proteins include quinoa and amaranth, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
  Sources of Incomplete Proteins
  With the exception of the complete plant-based proteins previously mentioned, other plant proteins are incomplete because they provide some, but not all, essential amino acids. Incomplete proteins are found in most grains, nuts, seeds, nut butters, green peas and legumes (such as lentils, chick peas, black beans, pinto beans and navy beans).
  Pairing Incomplete Proteins
  You don't have to eat complete proteins to get the essential amino acids your body needs. 
 6. https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002467.htm notes that as long as you consume all essential amino acids over the course of a day, your body can properly utilize those amino acids. However, you do have to carefully plan your diet if you're eating mainly plant-based proteins.
  7. University of Massachusetts notes that generally grains, nuts or seeds can be paired with legumes -- such as black beans and lentils -- to form complete proteins. Examples of such pairings include peanut butter on whole-grain bread, or brown rice with black beans.
  Daily Protein Requirements
  Chances are even if you're a vegetarian you're consuming at least some complete proteins, and a variety of incomplete proteins during the course of the day. If this is the case and you're meeting your total daily protein needs, your body is likely getting all the essential amino acids it needs. The recommended dietary allowance, or RDA, for protein is 56 grams for men, 46 grams for women, and 71 grams of protein daily for pregnant and nursing women. Active adults often benefit from exceeding these minimum daily needs.

 8. https://www.verywell.com/the-best-protein-sources-to-feed-your-muscles-3498455
  ‚ÄúHow Much Protein Do You Really Need?
  The average person needs about .8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or .37 grams per pound) according to the US Department of Agriculture. This means that a person weighing 130 pounds would require about 48 grams of protein. This, of course, is increased for weight lifters looking to build muscle to 1.5 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
  Without the necessary amount of protein, your body may start to develop a number of symptoms including fatigue during everyday activities, loss in muscle mass, compromised immune function and a greater risk of injury‚Ä¶‚Äù

protein in each scoop and usually used boost another protein liquid to make the ice cream just thick enough so that i could eat it with a spoon he also broke up a butterfinger candy bar and put that in there together with a big tablespoon of peanut butter i wanted to have at least 60 grams of protein in my diet every day i usually ate cheese eggs and bacon for breakfast i dont eat a lot of bread but im not going to give up sugar simply because i like to cook all kinds of pie cakes homemade rolls and especially my family loves macaroni and cheese made with velveeta cheese and buttered bread crumbs on top i actually didnt have that much of an appetite but i ate at regular times each day and kept account of all that i did eat during the times i was in chemotherapy by the way i too was once able to jump over skyscrapers and leap tall buildings in a single bound like superman i was a cheerleader in high school and loved every minute of it i really didnt understand a lot about football and really didnt know who even had the ball till the last man down got back up and i could see who had the ball and how i ever jumped 2 feet off the ground while arching my body in a backward c is beyond me now i consider it a major feat just to touch my toes now at age 77 i mostly just jump for joy these days i couldnt begin to walk 2 miles a day like michele however at age 48 i was raising my second set of children 3 boys and a girl and believe me they kept me jumping all day long so kudos to the both of you keep up those 2mile hikes and theyll have to change your name to little john and i did look up the cheerleading squad for the kansas city chiefs i doubt that micheles picture is in this group but that was quite an achievement so read up and eat up and enjoy each day by the way i love to cook and the pioneer woman is my favorite of the cooking shows on tv heres that link there are step by step videos as well as recipes she like i makes food from scratch now i dont know where that expression came from but it means make it yourself instead of getting it out of a box or just opening a can of course during chemo there might not be as much energy or appetite to do a big amount of

the proper growth and function of the human body there is considerable debate over the amount of protein a person needs to consume per day the current recommended daily intake rdi for protein is 46 grams for women aged 1970 and 56 grams for men aged 1970 any excess protein is turned into energy by the body and it is controversial whether this excess protein causes a strain on the liver a

________________________________________________________________ 5 while all proteins you eat contribute to meeting your daily protein requirements some proteins are better utilized by your body than others consuming complete protein in your diet is often beneficial but its not entirely necessary figuring out how to get the right balance proteins in your diet will help ensure you meet your bodys needs how they differ the main difference between complete and incomplete proteins is that complete proteins contain all essential amino acids your body requires daily and incomplete proteins only contain some essential amino acids your body breaks down the proteins you eat into amino acids which build and repair tissues in your body help digest food provide energy and perform numerous other body functions essential amino acids are also necessary for proper growth in children because complete proteins contain all essential amino acids they are often referred to as highquality proteins and easily utilized by your body sources of complete protein animal sources of protein are complete proteins and some plant foods contain all essential amino acids sources of complete animal proteins include milk yogurt cheese meat poultry fish seafood and eggs soy protein is a plantbased source of highquality complete protein grains that contain all essential amino acidsand are complete proteins include quinoa and amaranth according to the academy of nutrition and dietetics sources of incomplete proteins with the exception of the complete plantbased proteins previously mentioned other plant proteins are incomplete because they provide some but not all essential amino acids incomplete proteins are found in most grains nuts seeds nut butters green peas and legumes such as lentils chick peas black beans pinto beans and navy beans pairing incomplete proteins you dont have to eat complete proteins to get the essential amino acids your body needs 6 notes that as long as you consume all essential amino acids over the course of a day your body can properly utilize those amino acids however you do have to carefully plan your diet if youre eating mainly plantbased proteins 7 university of massachusetts notes that generally grains nuts or seeds can be paired with legumes such as black beans and lentils to form complete proteins examples of such pairings include peanut butter on wholegrain bread or brown rice with black beans daily protein requirements chances are even if youre a vegetarian youre consuming at least some complete proteins and a variety of incomplete proteins during the course of the day if this is the case and youre meeting your total daily protein needs your body is likely getting all the essential amino acids it needs the recommended dietary allowance or rda for protein is 56 grams for men 46 grams for women and 71 grams of protein daily for pregnant and nursing women active adults often benefit from exceeding these minimum daily needs _________________________________________________________ 8 how much protein do you really need the average person needs about 8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight or 37 grams per pound according to the us department of agriculture this means that a person weighing 130 pounds would require about 48 grams of protein this of course is increased for weight lifters looking to build muscle to 15 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight without the necessary amount of protein your body may start to develop a number of symptoms including fatigue during everyday activities

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/302821/delirium-confusion-hallucinatons,"Hello Everybody!
 My Mom, AGE 74, was diagnosed with Malignant StageIV in January 2015. She Completed 6 cycles of Carbo & Plat By July 2015. Mom responded remarkably well to the chemo with just the common side effects (neuropathy, fatigue, hair loss) Nothing major and she surprisingly looked as though she never had a treatment. They wanted 6 months till next round so the same Chemo combo would work again ff needed. (no cure promised but Quality Of Life) Surprisingly she did very well with scans and CA125's no big diff in growth. In Late January we revisited the oncologist who recommended radiation, which sent us to another oncologist and began ""staging"" how and where the radiation would be applied to. They found it was too close to the bowels so to prevent damage they referred us to another oncologist/gyno/surgeon to perform a laproscopic ovary removal. (Moms other ovary was removed as a hysterectomy age 42). We agreed. Feb 22nd 2016 the procedure ws performed, she came out of the removal with no issues, and recovery was swift. We were back in the garden the following week, she was using a walker to get around but other than that she had the strength and mind to get out and live! (she did have balance issues for a few years prior to diagnosis, so after chemo I insisted she always use a walker to prevent unnecessary falls). On March 3rd was her last bowel movement. We were giving her miralax, senokot, fiber etc, still nothing. On March 15th she began experiencing abdomen pains, on March 18th we went to the ER with massive pain in the abdomen, they immeadiately gave her morphine to manage the pain ASAP. After 2 failed visits to get her bowels moving with the tube through the nose procedure (her large hiatal hernia prevented full cean out) and a UTI & C-Diff in the hospital it was determined on 4/2 she needed Laproscopic Bowel Obstructon repair. On 4/5 The surgeon performed the procedure which became a full-abdominal opening to finally make the needed repair. The surgeon felt all went well, minimal blood loss, no colostomy required. Recovery at this point was TORTURE. The pain she experienced was enormous to the point where after 5 days she decided, no more pain please. They were administering a massive amount of dilaudid and sleeping alot and still no bowel activity, but they did insert a drain to get the matter out while recovering...On 4/12 I was SHOCKED when I saw her heart monitpr go bonklers after they insisted she take a walk, she had an AFIB incident (never ever had one in the past) and they determined it was post surgical reaction. Then started her on Digoxin and Diltiazem. ( which i protested to everyone after much research, but they continued to administer, as I was afraid of what might happen concerning the stress to recover, if we stopped it). Anyway, she was becoming more coherent but still in a lot of pain but her time to transfer to a rehab hospital had arrived.(4/17/16) She transferred next door and it semmed like not much more was happening except the passage of time to just heal with an occasional therapy session here AND THERE. She did experience her 1st bowel movement on April 26th (hooray!). On Aprill 29th we tranferred to SNF, she was having a tough time walking unassisted and using the restroom without asistance to clean up...SNF was a scary place I stayed with her as much as I could and was amazed at how many possible medication mistakes could be made if an advocate wasnt present, CRAZY! She got strong enough to walk, use the restroom, clean herself, but it appeared she was beginning to become confused and hallucinations. I brought her home on 5/12/16. It was a nailbiting 2.5 weeks, her confusion grew, the fear of falling was upfront because she would awake and forget where she was, why did she need a walker, etc....On 5/30 at 4am she woke me up in a panic and anxiety, slurred speech and elevated blodd pressure & pulse, I called 911, Ambu came and settled her down in ER. And this is where it appeared she had just checked out and became a very bitter, angry, person with paranoia, hallucinations and agressiveness. They ordered ALLTHE SCANS INCLUDING HEAD AND NECK. A Sitter was ordered in the hospital so I could get rest and run errands etc. It was determined by CT & X-ray new fluid had shown between her liver and lungs and they tapped it thinking this was the reason for the delirium/confusion, sent for tests. They started her on 2.5 Zyprexa once a day, and by day 2 it did seem to even her out, then it was just a matter of getting the test results. Unfortunately this came back as cancer filled fluid, beginning to spread to her kidneys and on her liver, it was a pretty vague diagnosis. Since she has been back home since 6/4 the aggresiveness has subsided, but she thinks she is in a different house at times, knows she is sick not really to what extent. she does know its cancer. Its so odd. I'm wondering if this is early signs of checking out or because of all the pain meds and stress of hospitilatons etc over the past 4 months has enhanced this condition. When I say VAGUE the diag of it spreading and test results were given to me via phone by a nurse. After finally getting her home I didnt want to add to her stress and wonder by going to see any more doctors in the short-term as she has made it very clear she WILL NOT DO ANYMORE CHEMO/SURGERYS. She did mention she would do one more scan to see exactly where it has spread and what the possible time frame is....Any thoughts on delirium/extended hosp stays/painkillers and metabolisms/cancer spread. I did speak with the 5 different doctors all week,everyday. I met Hospice & Quality of Life teams to have on standby as I tried day after day to diag her delirium. Any toughts as this situation is changing everyday and before I call QOL or HOSPICE, I want to get other opinions before bringing strangers in to her home. I am her SON & full-time caretaker.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/301348/stage-1c-g3,"Hi Ladies,
 Haven't been around for a while, I started chemo in January and have been so ill ever since. I'm having Carboplatin only but it clearly doesn't agree with me. I had my 3rd dose on 4th March and it was the wors one so far, eight days of sickness despite anti sickness medication. I still don't feel great, but am up and moving about the house. The sicky feeling still in the background.
 I've been doing some research on recurrence of stage 1C mixed cell histology, and can find lots of research on recurrence rates and survival for initial diagnosis but am looking to see if anyone has had complete remission after first recurrence. They tell me because my recurrence is isolated at the original site it is still stage 1C although the FIGO scoring system has changed and under the new one I am stage 2, so there is potential for it to be curative, I'm a but sceptical so loking for some inspiring information.
 I'm considering stopping chemo because of how ill I feel.
 Thoughts would be great

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/302150/fda-alert-avoid-cipro-rx-for-urinary-tract-infections-sinusitis-bronchitis-if-lesser-drugs-will-su,"Good evening friends~
 Today in my list of medical alerts, I see this article by the FDA released May 12, 2016. 
 Now we are told that Ciprofloxacin (Cipro), should not be used to treat uncomplicated infections such as sinusitis, bronchitis, and urinary tract infections for which other drug types are effective.
 Each one of us has, no doubt, have had CIPRO prescribed for our UTIs which are not uncommon with us. This just makes me wonder about the drugs doctors prescribe for us. After you read the article, there have been 25 comments which are also instructive.
 Just thought I would post this, because I suspect most of us have been diagnosed with sinusitis, bronchitis or a urinary tract infection at some point in our lives. CIPRO is an antibiotic commonly prescribed for UTIs. It has certainly been prescribed for me. Now I‚Äôll have to ask the doctor to consider alternatives with less side effects when I get sick next time.
 The last thing we need is a drug reaction from a strong drug to cure a common problem!

 ""FDA: Avoid Cipro, Similar Drugs for Common Infections - Agency says risks outweigh benefits
 byJohn Gever - Managing Editor, MedPage Today
 WASHINGTON -- Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, the class that includes ciprofloxacin (Cipro), should not be used to treat uncomplicated infections such as sinusitis, bronchitis, and urinary tract infections for which other drug types are effective, the FDA announced Thursday.
 Only patients with these conditions who can't be treated with other agents should receive fluoroquinolones, the agency said.
 ""An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e., tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together. These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system,"" the FDA said.
 Labels and medication guides for these agents will be updated to reflect the review's findings.
 The FDA noted that it has had concerns about fluoroquinolones for these uses for many years, having included boxed warnings about the tendon risks in 2008, for example.
 Last year, the agency convened an advisory committee meeting to review the risk-benefit balance for fluoroquinolones. The panel agreed that the balance was unfavorable for sinusitis, bronchitis, and other common conditions for which multiple treatment options exist.""",good evening friends today in my list of medical alerts i see this article by the fda released may 12 2016 now we are told that ciprofloxacin cipro should not be used to treat uncomplicated infections such as sinusitis bronchitis and urinary tract infections for which other drug types are effective each one of us has no doubt have had cipro prescribed for our utis which are not uncommon with us this just makes me wonder about the drugs doctors prescribe for us after you read the article there have been 25 comments which are also instructive just thought i would post this because i suspect most of us have been diagnosed with sinusitis bronchitis or a urinary tract infection at some point in our lives cipro is an antibiotic commonly prescribed for utis it has certainly been prescribed for me now ill have to ask the doctor to consider alternatives with less side effects when i get sick next time the last thing we need is a drug reaction from a strong drug to cure a common problem loretta peritoneal carcinomatosisovarian cancer stage iv note if you key in medpagetodaycom you will be able to verify the article however i just attempted to post it and got another security error so the exact article is quoted below but without the web reference fda avoid cipro similar drugs for common infections agency says risks outweigh benefits byjohn gever managing editor medpage today washington fluoroquinolone antibiotics the class that includes ciprofloxacin cipro should not be used to treat uncomplicated infections such as sinusitis bronchitis and urinary tract infections for which other drug types are effective the fda announced thursday only patients with these conditions who cant be treated with other agents should receive fluoroquinolones the agency said an fda safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically ie tablets capsules and injectable are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together these side effects can involve the tendons muscles joints nerves and central nervous system the fda said labels and medication guides for these agents will be updated to reflect the reviews findings the fda noted that it has had concerns about fluoroquinolones for these uses for many years having included boxed warnings about the tendon risks in 2008 for example last year the agency convened an advisory committee meeting to review the riskbenefit balance for fluoroquinolones the panel agreed that the balance was unfavorable for sinusitis bronchitis and other common conditions for which multiple treatment options exist,"Ciprofloxacin, Cipro, CIPRO",Yes,High,"disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects, can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system",none

By reading many posts, I feel I have a general grasp of info where I am actually an asset to my wife. When I get more time, I can explain her exact diagnosis. She's stage 3C or 4. The 2 litres of fluid they took off her lungs came back as suspicious of being cancerous but they did not say it was or it wasn't. I'm told if it is, then she is stage 4, and if it isn't then 3C. I also know that her treatment is exactly the same no matter which it is, but I also know the survival longevity has better odds if it's 3C compared to 4. My wife had her very first chemo 4 days ago which was Monday. What's weird is that she hasn't been much different than before she had chemo. By the way she calls this her ""Cleansing Treatments"", not chemo.....LOL. She got the normal Taxol/Carboplatin and we expected her to be sick part of the week, and she's had very mild effects. She's been taking the anti-nausea meds as prescribed, twice a day, and maybe staying on top of that is part of the reason. The next two Mondays she just gets the one single chemo drug, so am I too assume that the effects will even be less with the one single drug? We are both shocked that she isn't having ill effects or really tired or sluggish. Is it too early to know how she's going to react and once you keep stacking these Mondays on top of each other, is that when she will feel the normal symptoms of getting chemo?

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/302070/new-to-this-journey,"Greetings: I feel like I am in the twilight zone, but glad to have found this support network. Beginning last November after having the flu and then what was seemingly a bad reaction to anticiotics that resulted in stomach issues of diarrhea, nausea, vomitting, the symtpoms seemed to continue and appeared off and on. At times I had stomach pain and such bad nausea that I had to call off work. At some point, and it is now unclear, I noticed a mass or lump in my left lower abdominal area. At first I kind of ignored it. During this time, my appetite has been very poor, with bouts of nausea and inability to enjoy eating things I used to like. Eating just became a necessity, with no enjoyment. In late March to early April, I experienced another couple days of having to call out of work and realized I had to do something as my job was going to be in jeopardy. I went to a FastMed and they referred me to a gastroenterologist. I had colonoscopy and endoscopy on April 27, along with the gastro doc acknowledging that he felt the mass in my abdomen. He said there was an inflammed area of the colon that he sent out for biopsy; the uppper GI revealed severe acid reflux but nothing further noted. The doc said he still wanted me to schedule a CT scan, which I was able to do for today. A few days ago, the gastro doc called to say cancerous cells had been found in the biopsy, but he felt they came from the mass in the abdoment pressing on the colon. He believed it to be originating in the ovary. This evening he called me after the CT scan as he is getting me set up for a referral to an oncologisot or a gyncelogical oncologist, wasn't sure which. I told him from what I've read I would think the latter is best and he said it wasn't certain if the ovary was the primary site due to the cells being signet ring. Has anyone here experienced that? It is disturbing because it appears as though those cells mainly appear with a primary in the gastric region or stomach, het nothing was found on the endoscopy or colonoscopy other than what he felt was invasion of cells from the ovary. I am confused and extremely upset; was not even able to work the end of this week. I am not a young lady, though I have always felt like I am. I am 69 years young and feel like I have a long way to go in enjoying life. I feel as though I've been clubbed in the head! I have been encouraged the last couple of days reading the stories and accounts from many ovarian cancer survivors; or those who are living with the disease for several years. You are all an inspiration. This idea about the signet cells has me more uposet at the moment. I hope to have a good referral and appointment early next week. Thank you for any insite and help you may provide!

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/301979/worried-and-wondering,"so I came to this site because I'm worried and wondering. Hoping to gain some insight while I either wait, or figure out what to do. In early 2011 I had an abnormal pap. In June 2011 I had a cancer positive colpo. I became pregnant with my second son in Oct 2011 and my prenatal exam revealed that my pap was clean. I didn't have another pap until I became pregnant with my daughter in 2013. It was clean. She was born Aug 2014 and since some time after she was born...the last six months? Year? I've felt pain and cramps in my lower back and pelvic area. I've also noticed bowel changes and go through phases of pure fatigue. All of this can be explained away by diet, alcohol, lack of exercise, etc. Everything can be explained away. Guess that's why they call ovarian cancer the silent killer. I've been trying for over a year to get in to see my ob (which prompts me to say that my symptoms must have been going on for that long..?) and so far have been unable. All of my symptoms point to ovarian cancer, though they're largely general for many reproductive issues...cancer fits best. Then, recently, I noticed getting full faster or not having an appetite. Again, I can blame that on a lot of stress and diet, etc. Then, the last two months, mt periods have been 13 and 15 days long. NOT, I mean 100% NOT normal for me. I also feel pressure in my pelvic/bowel/rectum areas. Everything as I said, I can explain away. But I've also been under a lot of stress facing a possible divorce and drinking moderately for a week or two straight. But this isn't the only time I've drank a bit or been under stress. Seems my life is mostly a **** storm and I also lost my mom. My stress has never seemed to affect my period or my appetite, let alone caused abdominal and back pain or bowel changes. I'm really beginning to worry, with so many symptoms, and new ones seeming to add on, that I may potentially have ovarian cancer. Any insight on experience or on my symptoms or worries would be greatly appreciated. Don't worry about scaring me, you can't. I've accepted that it could very well be that and am prepared to handle it. If you know something or think something, please give me all you've got. I needed to find people that I can talk to about this, especially while I'm in the dark and only suspecting at this point.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/301654/my-experiences-with-hair-loss-during-chemo-treatments-its-not-uncommon,"Hello my friends:
 As you might note, both my husband and I have played ‚Äúrole reversals‚Äù. First he was diagnosed in 2002 with Esophageal Cancer, Stage III. Suddenly I became a caregiver. Stats are dismal and my husband is truly a ‚Äúmiracle.‚Äù April is ‚ÄúEsophageal Cancer Awareness Month‚Äù here in Virginia. Our Governor‚Äôs proclamation reads thus: ‚Äú‚Ä¶WHEREAS, the American Cancer Society estimate that in 2016 more than 16,500 new esophageal cancer cases will be diagnosed nationally, and more than 15,500 deaths will be caused by esophageal cancer in the United States alone‚Ä¶‚Äù, you can see that this is equally as devastating as Ovarian cancer stats. Sadly through these many years MOST of our EC friends died. And in both the case of Esophageal Cancer and Ovarian cancer, there are ‚Äúno early warning‚Äù tests to detect the presence of either type of cancer.
 Then in November of 2012, I was diagnosed with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis, then 3 weeks later a Second Opinion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with Ovarian cancer as well. So then our roles reversed. He is now a fantastic caregiver to me. (I am sorry that some of our sisters here struggle with having no close caregiver, thus an additional problem to cope with.) And so we both know what it‚Äôs like to be a caregiver as well as a cancer patient. In that regard, we have both had chemotherapy treatments and thus far are survivors.
 Recently an EC patient wrote my husband to ask about hair loss. My husband had Carboplatin & 5-FU. He didn‚Äôt lose his hair. My chemo was Carbo & Taxol and I began to lose my hair 2 weeks after the first treatment. (I have had 2 separate sessions of chemo and lost all my hair both times.) The first time round, my hair came in ‚Äúcurly‚Äù. Currently, my hair has grown back to the point that it looks like I have a crewcut. It is sticking straight up and is about 1 and ¬Ω inches long. That‚Äôs better than absolutely bald though. It‚Äôs also ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and when you get to be 77, I consider it a badge of honor. Many of us have dealt with enough tragedies to make our hair ‚Äústand on end‚Äù present diagnosis included! Then again we do thank God that we‚Äôre alive and from that perspective after the initial shock, on a scale of 1 to 10, dealing with being bald is no biggie for me. 
 And on a totally unrelated thought, wonder who coined the word ‚Äúpermanents‚Äù for our hair when one rarely last 6 months?
 Some chemo cocktails predictably cause a high percentage of hair loss. The ‚ÄúChemoCare.Com‚Äù website is excellent for looking up the details of all types of chemo. Probabilities percentage wise for side effects are listed. So I refer to that site often. It‚Äôs okay to wait and see how the chemo affects you, but if you‚Äôre like I was, by Week 2 the hair was coming out in the hairbrush in big amounts. So by the 3rd week, you will probably know for certain how your hair is going to respond to the treatments. It may not affect you but it may ‚Äúthin out or ‚Äúfall out!‚Äù
 Although I know that loss of hair can be ‚Äúdemoralizing‚Äù, you must remember that the hair will grow back in time, but we hope the cancer will not. Both Carboplatin and Taxol can result in hair loss. And, my oh my, wouldn‚Äôt it be wonderful if while going through chemotherapy, our only side effect was hair loss? In Sept. of 2015, have just completed my second series of Carboplatin and Taxol. Each time my hair began to ‚Äúturn loose‚Äù (fall out) within two weeks of treatment. So it became so thin I just went to the beauty salon and had my head shaved since I had already shopped for wigs and hairpieces the first time around. Granted the second time around, the shock is not as great. Yes it is a bit demoralizing from the ‚Äúbeauty standpoint‚Äù, but the prospect that the chemo will kill the cancer cells, is by far the greater benefit. Actually, some days I rarely think about my cancer, until I look in the mirror and see that I don‚Äôt have much hair. 
 Not only did I lose the hair on top of my head, it took the eyebrows and eyelashes as well. One good thing‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have to worry about shaving my legs. Come to think of it, wouldn‚Äôt you hate to have to shave your face every day? That brings up one more problem though. When the hair starts to come back, ironically I start to see ‚Äúfacial fuzz‚Äù and long ‚Äúwild‚Äù hairs on my chin and around my lips. Thankfully, most of them are white, but some of them are black! That‚Äôs not a pretty site. So far I just clip them as close as I can with scissors. My eye sight is not what it used to be so I use a 10X magnifying make-up mirror. That way I don‚Äôt put lipstick where eye shadow‚Äôs supposed to be! J
 These are the ‚Äútradeoffs‚Äù to living longer. Do I want to look a bit worse for wear on the ‚Äúoutside,‚Äù while I get better on the inside‚Äîyou bet! I think you will adjust to the hair loss more quickly when you think of the good that the chemo will be doing to kill the cancer. Furthermore, there are hair pieces, wigs, turbans, etc. that you can wear that can make you look normal. If you‚Äôre interested in choosing something that matches your hair, if and when it begins to fall out, save a larger swatch of your hair, and then you can ‚Äúmatch‚Äù it to the hair colors in this catalog. My nurse gave me a copy. If your oncology office doesn‚Äôt have any, you may order a free catalog on the web. I‚Äôve been totally satisfied with everything I‚Äôve purchased. And no, I don‚Äôt have any affiliation with the company. Therein will be instructions on how to measure your head in order to get the right size. So here is that address.
 1. http://thewigcompany.com/face-framer-regular-length-halo-headband-hairpiece/p/J182/
 I have one of these headband hairpieces that I wear under my turbans and people never know it isn‚Äôt real.
 2. http://thewigcompany.com/turbans+&+headcovers/vc/turbans+&+headcovers-turbans/
 I purchased several of these turbans in different colors to match my clothes. I have used my ‚Äúfake bangs‚Äù underneath my turban most of the time. I feel like myself when I go out in public. People think it‚Äôs my real hair until I tell them. So for the best look, like I have said before, if your hair starts to fall out, I found ‚Äúsolace‚Äù in these wigs, bangs and hairpieces. I think you will be very happy. J
 One last thing, depending on your insurance company, your doctor may write a prescription for a wig, and it may be covered by insurance. (There may be a local wig shoppe that would offer cancer patients one for free as well.) However, my insurance didn‚Äôt pay for it. I found the wigs in this catalog were far more reasonably priced than the one I purchased at a local wig shoppe. Returns can be made if the hairpiece hasn‚Äôt been worn, and it is returned promptly. 
 And ladies, considering the current world chaos, aren‚Äôt we still happy to have a head, while all about us others are ‚Äúlosing theirs?‚Äù YES we are! So let‚Äôs just hold our head high as we move on!
 Loretta

 Below are helpful web links from ChemoCare.com that will inform you as to the side effects of these two chemo drugs most often prescribed initially for Ovarian Cancer patients‚ÄîCarboplatin and Taxol.

  ‚Äú‚Ä¶What is hair loss and how is chemotherapy related?
 Believe it or not, hair loss (alopecia) due to chemotherapy is one of the most distressing side effects of chemo treatments. 
 Hair loss happens because the chemotherapy affects all cells in the body, not just the cancer cells. The lining of the mouth, stomach, and the hair follicles are especially sensitive because those cells multiply rapidly just like the cancer cells. The difference is that the normal cells will repair themselves, making these side effects temporary. 
 Hair loss does not occur with all chemotherapy. Whether or not your hair remains as it is, thins or falls out, depends on the drugs and dosages. 
 Hair loss may occur as early as the second or third week after the first cycle of chemotherapy, although it may not happen until after the second cycle of chemotherapy. 
 Hair loss can be sudden or slow. 
 You may lose all of your hair or just some of it. 
 Often it comes out in clumps rather than an even pattern. 
 It is common for hair loss to include hair that grows anywhere including eyelashes, eyebrows, and even pubic hair.
 In almost all cases of chemotherapy-induced hair loss, your hair will resume growth after treatments. 
 It may take from three to six months after therapy is completed or it may start growing back while you are still receiving chemotherapy. Be prepared for your ""new"" hair to possibly have a slightly different color, texture, or curl.
 Can you prevent hair loss during chemo treatments?
 Through the years, attempts have been made to reduce hair loss by using tight bands or ice caps. While these techniques may reduce hair loss by reducing blood flow to the scalp and limiting chemotherapy exposure to hair follicles, there is a theoretical concern that this could reduce the effectiveness of treatment in that area. 
 What can be done to manage hair loss due to chemotherapy?
 Management of hair loss focuses on your own comfort, or discomfort with baldness and on keeping your head warm if you live in a cool climate, as well as protection from the sun. The following are options to consider, the best option is the one that is most comfortable for you:
 Short hair - Cut your hair short if you are expecting hair loss during chemotherapy. Since hair often does not fall out evenly, some find losing short hair is less distressing. Some people shave their heads once the hair begins to fall out.
 Wigs - If you are interested in purchasing a wig, the best time to do this is before you lose any hair. This helps the stylist create the best match. Many insurance companies will pay for a wig, so be sure you have it written as a prescription from your doctor (usually written as ""cranial prosthesis""). There are wig stylists who specialize in wigs for alopecia (hair loss). Check your yellow pages or ask at the doctor's office.
 Caps and Scarves - Some people find that the easiest, and most comfortable options are caps and scarves. These range from those you may already own to custom items made expressly for people who are undergoing chemotherapy.
 You might check with your local chapter of the American Cancer Society. They sponsor a program called ""Look Good, Feel Better."" This program addresses ways to tie scarves and ways to make yourself look and feel better while experiencing hair loss during and after chemotherapy‚Ä¶‚Äù
 6. http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/Paclitaxel.aspx
 TAXOL - ‚Äú‚Ä¶Side Effects of Paclitaxel:
 Important things to remember about the side effects of Paclitaxel include:
 Most people do not experience all of the side effects listed.
 Side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration.
 Side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.
 There are many options to help minimize or prevent side effects.
 There is no relationship between the presence or severity of side effects and the effectiveness of the medication.
 The side effects of Paclitaxel and their severity vary depending on how much of the drug is given, and/or the schedule in which it is given.
 The following side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients taking Paclitaxel:
 Low blood counts. Your white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily decrease. This can put you at increased risk for infection, anemia and/or bleeding.
 Hair loss
 Arthralgias and myalgias, pain in the joints and muscles. (see pain) Usually temporary occurring 2 to 3 days after Paclitaxel, and resolve within a few days.
 Peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling of the hands and feet)
 Nausea and vomiting (usually mild)
 Diarrhea
 Mouth sores
 Hypersensitivity reaction. Fever, facial flushing, chills, shortness of breath, or hives after Paclitaxel is given (see allergic reaction). The majority of these reactions occur within the first 10 minutes of an infusion. Notify your healthcare provider immediately (premedication regimen has significantly decreased the incidence of this reaction)‚Ä¶‚Äù

satisfied with everything ive purchased and no i dont have any affiliation with the company therein will be instructions on how to measure your head in order to get the right size so here is that address 1 i have one of these headband hairpieces that i wear under my turbans and people never know it isnt real 2 i purchased several of these turbans in different colors to match my clothes i have used my fake bangs underneath my turban most of the time i feel like myself when i go out in public people think its my real hair until i tell them so for the best look like i have said before if your hair starts to fall out i found solace in these wigs bangs and hairpieces i think you will be very happy j one last thing depending on your insurance company your doctor may write a prescription for a wig and it may be covered by insurance there may be a local wig shoppe that would offer cancer patients one for free as well however my insurance didnt pay for it i found the wigs in this catalog were far more reasonably priced than the one i purchased at a local wig shoppe returns can be made if the hairpiece hasnt been worn and it is returned promptly and ladies considering the current world chaos arent we still happy to have a head while all about us others are losing theirs yes we are so lets just hold our head high as we move on loretta

initially for ovarian cancer patientscarboplatin and taxol 3 chemotherapy drugs and drugs often used during chemotherapy home page 4 web link for how carboplatin is administered and its accompanying side effects 5 what is hair loss and how is chemotherapy related believe it or not hair loss alopecia due to chemotherapy is one of the most distressing side effects of chemo treatments hair loss happens because the chemotherapy affects all cells in the body not just the cancer cells the lining of the mouth stomach and the hair follicles are especially sensitive because those cells multiply rapidly just like the cancer cells the difference is that the normal cells will repair themselves making these side effects temporary hair loss does not occur with all chemotherapy whether or not your hair remains as it is thins or falls out depends on the drugs and dosages hair loss may occur as early as the second or third week after the first cycle of chemotherapy although it may not happen until after the second cycle of chemotherapy hair loss can be sudden or slow you may lose all of your hair or just some of it often it comes out in clumps rather than an even pattern it is common for hair loss to include hair that grows anywhere including eyelashes eyebrows and even pubic hair in almost all cases of chemotherapyinduced hair loss your hair will resume growth after treatments it may take from three to six months after therapy is completed or it may start growing back while you are still receiving chemotherapy be prepared for your new hair to possibly have a slightly different color texture or curl can you prevent hair loss during chemo treatments through the years attempts have been made to reduce hair loss by using tight bands or ice caps while these techniques may reduce hair loss by reducing blood flow to the scalp and limiting chemotherapy exposure to hair follicles there is a theoretical concern that this could reduce the effectiveness of treatment in that area what can be done to manage hair loss due to chemotherapy management of hair loss focuses on your own comfort or discomfort with baldness and on keeping your head warm if you live in a cool climate as well as protection from the sun the following are options to consider the best option is the one that is most comfortable for you short hair cut your hair short if you are expecting hair loss during chemotherapy since hair often does not fall out evenly some find losing short hair is less distressing some people shave their heads once the hair begins to fall out wigs if you are interested in purchasing a wig the best time to do this is before you lose any hair this helps the stylist create the best match many insurance companies will pay for a wig so be sure you have it written as a prescription from your doctor usually written as cranial prosthesis there are wig stylists who specialize in wigs for alopecia hair loss check your yellow pages or ask at the doctors office caps and scarves some people find that the easiest and most comfortable options are caps and scarves these range from those you may already own to custom items made expressly for people who are undergoing chemotherapy you might check with your local chapter of the american cancer society they sponsor a program called look good feel better this program addresses ways to tie scarves and ways to make yourself look and feel better while experiencing hair loss during and after chemotherapy 6 taxol side effects of paclitaxel important things to remember about the side effects of paclitaxel include most people do not experience all of the side effects listed side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete there are many options to help minimize or prevent side effects there is no relationship between the presence or severity of side effects and the effectiveness of the medication the side effects of paclitaxel and their severity vary depending on how much of the drug is given andor the schedule in which it is given the following side effects are common occurring in greater than 30 for patients taking paclitaxel low blood counts your white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily decrease this can put you at increased risk for infection anemia andor bleeding hair loss arthralgias and myalgias pain in the joints and muscles see pain usually temporary occurring 2 to 3 days after paclitaxel and resolve within a few days peripheral neuropathy numbness and tingling of the hands and feet nausea and vomiting usually mild diarrhea mouth sores hypersensitivity reaction fever facial flushing chills shortness of breath or hives after paclitaxel is given see allergic reaction the majority of these reactions occur within the first 10 minutes of an infusion notify your healthcare provider immediately premedication regimen has significantly decreased the

 What I would really like is to have us all in one room together. And, very glad to be here with you. I just had my fourth round of chemo and a big up in neuropathy after this one. Have any of you experienced neuropathy with little knives or lightening bolts in your calves and buckling when you walk? I have two more rounds to go, im thinking the chemo has to change (again) if I'm still going to have walking power when I'm finished. I have casinosarcoma so they are really giving me a lot. They stopped the cissplatin because it was doing my kidneys in, and they stopped all abdominal infusions. Now I am getting carbonation and taxol, IV.
 Im going to check into medical marijuana. I'm in VT. Is anyone using it? For what purpose? Is it useful?
 For now, thanks for your thoughts and your fight.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/298668/the-waiting-game,"Hello all, 
 I'm new to this site. I had thyroid cancer last year. (Complete thyroidectomy and radiation). 
 I've always had an issue with ovarian cysts. I had been told that it was a normal part of being a woman so I never really gave it much thought. I was just going to be ""one of those"" women who had issues. 
 A few weeks ago, I woke with a pretty sharp pain in my lower left side. On top of previously having cancer, I've also been diagnosed with RA and occasionally when my levels are off, I'll go full ""hypo"". I figured the pains had something to do with my levels being off and attempted to go about my day. But it just got worse, and worse, and worse and then finally, it got so bad that I literally passed out for a moment. The hubs said I went completely pale (which is a feat for me because I'm naturally ghost white as it is). Once I woke up, I threw up. 
 Called my primary to attempt to make an appointment and instead was directed to the ER. So off I go to the E.R. Several hours, an IV, and a scan or two later and I'm sent home with the instructions to follow up with my gyn as soon as possible and that I had what was most likely ""a ruptured ovarian cyst"" but they couldn't find any fluid from the rupture. 
 Okay fine. But when the doctor was discharging me, he asked if I was done having children. I was just ready to be done at the time and to go home so it wasn't until later that struck me as an odd thing to say to a 32 year old woman. (Who was holding her 2 and 4 year olds)
 I followed up with my gyn. Had a few more scans and was sent home to wait on the results. Results came back. Essentially, my left ovary is mostly a complex cyst and my right has two very large simple cysts. When I went back to my gyn, he immediately began to go over surgery options and was sent to have my CA125 done. 
 I'll have those results on Monday. 
 Right now, given my previous history with cancer, he's a bit concerned that my left ovary is cancerous. He'd like to get aggressive and not only remove my left, but my right one as well and my uterus. His explanation was that he was afraid that if I left my right one in, that I would be right back to where I am now in 3 weeks, months, or years and having to have a repeat surgery. 
 I don't know what to do. Do I follow his advice, do I get aggressive and put myself into surgical menopause or do I wait it out and see what happens to my right after my left is removed? 
 The waiting is terrible. What should I do? Should I wait it out and keep my right so I don't have to do the whole hormone replace therapy thing? Should I get aggressive? Given my ultrasoun results and my previous history, what is the likelyhood that this is ovarian cancer? 
 I had been having a few other problems as of late as well. I am urinating more often, intercourse has been a bit painful, I'm quite bloated... but these were things I could all chalk up to the thyroid issues or the RA. 
 Thanks so much, sorry about the novella.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/290205/my-new-oncologists-cutting-edge-approach-is-saving-my-life,"‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù ran a segment last night (you can find it online) about an oncologist and research scientist in LA ‚Äì Dr. Patrick Soon-Shoing ‚Äì who is championing a low-dose, multi-chemo approach to fighting cancer. This is exactly what my own oncologist, Dr. Howard Bruckner, has been doing with tremendous success for years. ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù reported that Dr. Soon-Shoing (the inventor, by the way, of the chemo agent Abraxane) has also had tremendous success with this program and has poured a billion dollars of his own money (yes, he happens to be phenomenally wealthy) into conducting research on it as well as immuno therapy and other cutting edge treatments. Moreover, his focus is on individualizing treatment by profiling the genetic make-up of individuals‚Äô specific cancer type. 
  Mainstream treatment still involves a mono-focus on the origin of one‚Äôs cancer (ovarian, colon, lung, etc.) and a cookie-cutter, everyone-gets-the-same-high-dose protocol approach to fighting the disease. And when it stops working, as it invariably does for many people, they send you home. That is what happened to me. After fighting ovarian cancer for almost seven years (with two 24-mo and 12-mo remissions, respectively), going to three different respected cancer treatment centers (Washington Hospital Center, Sloane-Kettering, and Johns Hopkins), and being treated with the standard high dose Carbo-Taxol, then Cisplatin-Taxol, and finally, Doxil-Carbo regimens, I was sent home this past June ‚Äì by Hopkins ‚Äì with the words, ‚ÄúThere is nothing more we can do.‚Äù I was appalled and disgusted. I am 52 years old, entirely fit, and still full of fight and energy. It seemed that someone on the hospital‚Äôs board simply decided I no longer fit into their cost-benefit analysis for patient care. (Individualizing treatment takes up a lot of expensive doctor time.)
  Hopkins, it turns out, did me a favor. Within two weeks I had found Dr. Howard Bruckner who has a practice in the Bronx, NY. Dr. Bruckner wears two hats, that of a scientist and that of a caring, brilliant M.D. He began his professional life conducting oncology research at the NIH. He then moved on to practice, but became disillusioned by the bureaucracy, fear, and self-interest that prevents most oncologists at large medical institutions from thinking creatively and doing all that they know is best for their patients. So, in his late sixties, when many accomplished M.D.s could start thinking of retirement, he began his own practice that offers exactly what the ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù report yesterday described. I have been in treatment with Dr. Bruckner for several months now and have met countless people in his infusion room who state that they too were given up on, that they too were basically sent home to die, and that Dr. Bruckner brought them from Stage 4 ‚Äúno hope‚Äù to remission or getting there. I happen to have an extremely rare cell type ‚Äì mucinous adenocarcinoma which, in its morphology, is more like a gastrointestinal cancer than it is ovarian. Dr. Bruckner suspected this, got it confirmed via a biopsy, had my tissue samples profiled, and has tailored my chemo to my cell type. I have never received so much close attention and concern from a doctor in all of my many years. And he and his wonderful partner ‚Äì Dr. Azriel Hirschfeld (who is some decades younger) ‚Äì are forever looking into the future on behalf of their patients. They do not relax their vigilance even when their patients go into remission. Each time I went into remission at previous institutions, I was simply sent home and told to reappear in three months. There was no maintenance therapy, no more frequent check-ups, nothing. Drs. Bruckner and Hirschfeld develop plans for the ‚Äúremission‚Äù stage. They remain forever on guard and want us, their patients, to eventually remain in remission indefinitely. They never give up.
  Dr. Bruckner‚Äôs low-dose, multi-chemo approach works immediately for many, many people no matter how sick they are when they arrive. It makes sense ‚Äì to slam the cancer from multiple angles simultaneously so that it does not have a chance to develop a resistance as it so often does when you hit it with just one or two agents. However, Bruckner and Hirschfeld are also using immuno therapy to fight the disease ‚Äì sometimes simultaneously with the chemo, more often after the chemo has already had a positive effect. And perhaps most importantly, they really see each person as an individual with a unique health history, disease profile, and immune system. They spend a lot of time getting to know their patients and tailoring their treatment program accordingly. If something they are doing does not seem to be working, they try something else. They are as humble as they are brilliant.
  I live outside of Washington, DC, and it has involved a great upheaval for me to travel to NYC every two weeks for treatment. But it has been worth it. And I write this without any self-interest whatsoever. I am actually feeling quite ill at the moment from infusions I received last week, but I wanted to get online and tell as many of you as possible about the ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù segment and of my own doctor‚Äôs work should this information help anyone else. Bruckner Oncology‚Äôs telephone number is 718-732-4050. You can also call me if you have any questions. Just send me a message, and I will send you my phone number.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/298099/my-story-need-advice,"Hi everyone,
 
 I'm a Thy Ca survivor, with an undiagnosed ovarian mass. Long story short, they found a solid mass in my left ovary in March, were supposed to remove it in April, removed the wrong ovary, and I still have a mass 8 months later. All of my tests have come back indeterminate. Was wondering if anyone had any insight into any of this. I am just so beyond tired of not getting any answers...everytime we think we are going to get somewhere, I get a similar result...good parts and bad parts. After the last MRI, we decided to wait (since I didn't want to lose my other ovary unless necessary) until December to do another MRI and compare, but over the past few weeks, I've been having a lot of pain on my left side again, now radiating into my hip and down my leg....not constant. It comes and goes, but painful enough to have me worried again. Any help would be appreciated. God bless. Here are the results of all of the tests I've had:
 
  Here were my original U/S results:
 3/5/15:
 
 Impression:
 
 1. Mild thickened endometrium w/o associated vascularity. Recommend correlation w/ patient‚Äôs menstrual cycle and cont. f/u as indicated.
 
 2. Small (2.4 cm) probably left ovary hemorrhagic cyst. Large (3.5 cm) solid appearing left ovarian lesion w/o associated vascularity, indeterminate. Recommend follow up pelvic u/s in 6 weeks and/or MRI w/ IV contrast for further evaluation.
 
  
 Right ovary measures 2.7 x 1.6 x 2.2 cm. Left ovary measures 7.1 x 4.8 x 3.8 cm. There is a new hypoechoic cyst w/associated fibrin strands noted in the left ovary measuring 2.4 x 1.9 x 2.6 and most likely a hemorrhagic cyst. There is also a new isoechoic solid appearing lesion in the left ovary measuring 3.4 x 3.1 x 3.5 cm without associated vascularity, indeterminate.
 
  
 So, I had a small hemorrhagic cyst on the left ovary accompanied by a large solid lesion.
 
  
 I had my surgery on 4/21/15 and wasn't told until 2 weeks later that they removed the wrong ovary. Had to wait 8 more weeks to have the follow up U/S, which is below.
 
  6/15/15-U/S #2:
 The uterus and right ovary are not visualized compatible with patient‚Äôs known history of hysterectomy and right oophorectomy.
 
  
 The left ovary measures 5.3x3.4x2.3 cm. In the left ovary there is a septated left ovarian mass with stable solid and hypoechoic components. There is internal flow within the septation on color Doppler images. The isoechoic solid appearing avascular component measures 2.1 x 1.8 x 2.1 cm. The stable avascular hypoechoic component measures 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.9 cm.
 
  
 Impression: Stable appearance of indeterminate septated left ovarian mass with solid appearing and hypoechoic components. There is internal flow within the septation. Follow up MRI with contrast recommended for further characterization.
 
  
 I got a call from my family doc saying to call a gyn/onc and get this removed asap. I went to a great facility in the city near me, and she said that it was possible that it was a dermoid, however it was possible it was more serious, and I do have some concerning family history, so I was to wait a few more weeks and get an MRI.
 
  
 7/29/15 MRI:
 
 Multicomponent cystic lesion within the left adnexa. There are areas of precontrast T1 hyperintense signal within this lesion suggesting hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cystic components. Enhancing intervening solid tissue within this lesion. Differential condideration would include multiple ovarian cysts, some of which are complex or cystadenoma/adenocarcinoma.
 
  
 There is a left adnexal multicomponent predominately T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense lesion. The conglomerate dimensions of this lesion measure approximately 5.7 x 4.0 x 2.7 cm Portions of this lesion have hyperintense T1 signal on precontrast sequences. These T1 hyperintense components are as follows---the more lateral of which measures approximately 7 mm and the more anterior of which measures approximately 11 x 6 mm. Post contrast sequences demonstrate intervening enhancing tissue within this left adnexal mass. The area of enhancing tissue measures approximately 1.5 x 0.8 x 2.5 cm.
 
  
 The Dr. called me after the MRI and again said it was indeterminate. Some things are concering, others are good. She said that the radiologist was OK with waiting a few more months and repeating the MRI so that we could compare MRI to MRI, instead of MRI to U/S. I agreed, because honestly, I was just mentally exhausted from the whole thing. Now, I'm having pain. I finally put a call out to her today, and we've been playing phone tag. I seriously just can't take anymore not knowing. It would be so much easier to deal with if I knew WHAT I was dealing with. I would appreciate any input so much.

I have been on it for over a year for a bout with breast cancer, and my CA125 seems to be doing the jumping-jacks. It has gone from 13 to 16 back down to 15 up to 28 then 35 now back to 31. My CT for OVCA follow-up is clear, but given how I feel on this medication I'm wondering if it's affecting the CA125. Previously I had been maintaining steady levels between 13 and 19. My doctor wants me to call my other oncologist and switch, but quite frankly, it will just be trading one set of probolems for a nother. He's also suggesting a PET scan, as he doesn't always find a CT conclusive. My pelvic exam also proved to indicate NED.
 Other than the CA125 rise, I am fatigued, have gained a large amount of weight, especially in the midsection, low interested in food, and when I do eat I seem to get indigestion and feeling of fullness in the ujpper abdoment.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/297175/please-help-terrified-ascites-issue-post-ovarian-cancer-treatment,"My mother was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer around 9 years back. It was discovered at a late stage so the doctors removed her ovaries along with the tumor. The cancer was treated through chemotherapy and she did well for a couple of years before it came back again. For the past 5-6 years, she has been on and off the chemotherapies but the last 2 years have been really rough. The doctors were unable to control cancer which was spreading all over, and she received close to 30 chemotherapy sessions during this time. Now cancer looks to be under control, CA125 is close to 17 but ascites is really troubling her. She has lost a lot of body weight, is unable to take a proper diet because of the fluid in her body, and her last chemotherapy session had to be cancelled as she is too weak to withstand the medicine.
  The ascites problem started 3-4 months back. Around 4 litres of fluid was removed from her body every 4-5 weeks initially but now this time interval is decreasing. Most recently, she had to get the fluid removed after just 10 days. She is unable to walk on her own and having a lot of pain in back because of the weight of fluid in her stomach. Her hands, arms, and feet are all swollen. In short, she's in a very bad situation and we're really worried about her. I had the hardest conversation of my life with the doctor who said my mother might survive another 4-5 months. He suggested giving her the medicine Avastin 400 mg which might give her some more time and improve the quality of her life, but I couldn't find any source confirming that Avastin is used to cure ascites problem. Moreover, her body is not in a condition to withstand any more chemotherapies. 
  I'd really appreciate if anyone could share their experience with the Ascites issue. We talked to another doctor who said this is one of the side effects of chemotherapy and she'll start getting better now as her treatment is over, but her condition is deteriorating every day. What should we expect? Is the first doctor right about her life expectancy? We are giving her salt-free diet, just a small step which might make a slight difference. Are there any other ways to cure Ascites? Please help me!

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/297354/need-some-advice,"Hi all! Popping over from the H&N board.
 Background: I was diagnosed with Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma in 2012 at age 27. There is no known chemo treatment so the tumor was surgically removed & then followed with 6 weeks of radiation. 
  Current issue: I have had two babies since treatment, I have 3 kids all together. My youngest was born in March 2015. The PP bleeding never seemed to stop so at my after baby well check (May 2015)my OBGYN did transvaginal u/s. It was quick, but they said everything looked normal. I was told to call back if bleeding didn't stop after another week. It stopped. The following month my family made a cross country move. I started my period like clockwork & again bleeding never stopped. I made an appt with a new OBGYN. They got me in fairly quickly. Pelvic exam was done & Dr said my uterus was enlarged but could just be cysts. I was put on progesterone and the bleeding stopped. Periods have been normal since, except for being more painful & heavier than before my last baby. In July I followed up with my new OBGYN & he also did my pap. Everything was normal on that front. He did however mention that if I were 5 years older & presented with the same symptoms, he would worry about ovarian cancer because I am overweight. 
 Since July I have noticed some trouble completely emptying my bladder, recurring upset stomach and some slight tenderness in my belly. So, I am wondering if I am completely over thinking things and all these things can be attributed to stress, having a baby 7 months ago, my weight, etc. Or, should I be concerned enough to request another appt with my Dr & ask for an ultrasound? I feel like I have done a decent job in the last 3 years of not assuming all aches and pains might be related to cancer but I find myself being super uneasy, even without a long list of symptoms. Also, I have regular scans following my cancer diagnosis and had blood work and a full body CT scan done in April, although I don't think my blood work checks for the markers that a lot of you talk about because mine was a head and neck cancer. I also have no family history of breast or GYN cancers.
  I also had a friend of mine who passed away from ovarian cancer at the very young age of 30. She was very overweight, but had just completely turned her life around & lost over 100 lbs. She went to the ER one night and they found very advanced stage cancer. She passed away about a week after debulking surgery. 
  I am hoping that you ladies may be able to ease my mind a bit. I started lurking here occasionally when my friend passed away 2 years ago. I have followed a lot of your stories & admire you a lot.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/297298/hipec-hyperthermic-intraperitoneal-chemotherapy-ip-intraperitoneal-chemotherapy-specific-repl,"October 10, 2015
  Dear ‚Äúmyljon3@yahoo‚Äù
  Since reading your entry, I decided to look up some references regarding the Intraperitoneal Chemo treatments. I am addressing this letter to you in particular but decided to put it on a separate entry so others could access the info as well, if they are not familiar with it. Anyone anticipating surgery, or having just been diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer or Peritoneal Carcinomatosis may find it useful.
  I was first diagnosed with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in November of 2012. First I went to my regular GP thinking I might have a hernia since I felt a small ‚Äúlump‚Äù on the left side of my abdomen. He just examined my abdomen with a touch of his hands and concurred that it was most likely had a hernia. He asked if I wanted to just wait a while and see if things improved. Before I could answer he said, ‚ÄúI can tell by the look on your face that you don‚Äôt want to wait.‚Äù So he made arrangements for me to see a surgeon. However, a week later I experienced some sharp groin pain and general abdominal discomfort that lasted for 3 days so I went to the Emergency room. After going through the routine questions and examination, they gave me a CT.
  The physician handed me a copy of my CT scan. Since my husband is a 15-year survivor of Esophageal Cancer, Stage III (3N1M0). (That is a miracle for which we thank the Lord.) I immediately recognized familiar cancer terms. Bottom line‚Äîmy symptoms were actually cancer‚Äînot a hernia. The doctor showed me my scan on a computer screen, and pointed out multiple tumors floating around in the peritoneal fluid in my abdomen. From there I began an informative search on the web to find out what this cancer was all about.
  Since my husband had successful surgery with the latest laparoscopic procedure for Esophageal Cancer, (MIE), we contacted his surgeon, Dr. James Luketich, Chief of Thoracic Surgery, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, (UPMC) for advice and a second opinion. He in turn, referred me to his associate, Dr. David Bartlett. We sent my records there and made an appointment for possible exploratory surgery in December 2012. At that time a PET/CT scan revealed that the cancer was also in my ovaries. Moreover, the tumors were too large and too numerous to do Cytoreductive surgery at that time. I was told to come home, undergo chemotherapy treatment, and then another consultation would be in order. 
  So my chemo treatments of Carboplatin/Taxol began the early part of 2013. Thankfully, the tumors were reduced to an operable level, so surgery took place at Passavant Hospital, one of many hospitals at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, on July 1, 2013. For anyone who has had Cytoreductive surgery, no explanation is necessary. I should say that at age 36, and I am now 76, I had a hysterectomy but only my uterus was removed. My Ovaries and Fallopian tubes were left intact. My gynecologist told me recently that many physicians now believe that Ovarian cancer actually begins in the Fallopian tubes, so from now on he is going to remove everything when he performs a hysterectomy.
  In hindsight, I would concur with that completely (take out everything!) So if you know anyone who is contemplating having a hysterectomy, they might want to consider having everything removed. Anyway, my doctors at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) concluded that most likely this cancer began in my ovaries and then spread to the peritoneal fluid in my abdomen. (Sometimes the primary cancer isn‚Äôt determined before it shows up in the Peritoneal fluid.) So now I just go by the diagnosis, Ovarian Cancer Stage IV. And yes, that‚Äôs terminal at some point, but my times are in the Lord‚Äôs hands, and I am making the best use of doctors and medicines HE has blessed us with here in America. 
  Needless to say, after the Cytorductive (debulking) Surgery was performed, I was completely ‚Äúwiped out‚Äù, perhaps I should have said ‚Äúcleaned out!‚Äù Doctors said they would remove ‚Äúnon-essential organs‚Äù. With that they removed my Gall Bladder, Spleen, Ovaries, Fallopian tubes, Omentum, and resectioned my Intestines. Had I had an appendix, that would have been removed as well, but I had Appendicitis at age 12, so that saved me one snip! 
  When going into surgery, I fully expected to have the HIPEC Chemotherapy as part of my surgery. We had discussed it as a possibility. Not until I came out from under the effects of the surgery did I know that Dr. Bartlett opted NOT to perform the additional chemo treatment. Naturally I wasn‚Äôt going to ask for a do-over! J I went in trusting his judgment and am content to be in as good a shape as I am today. However, other patients that I met while there did have the Cytoreductive (CRS) surgery plus the HIPEC treatment. So obviously it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgiven‚Äù that each patient will be treated the same. I am certain that the ‚Äúspecific diagnosis‚Äù and the condition of the patient will determine the treatment process. Moreover, I was happy to be eligible to be a ‚Äúsurgical candidate at age 74. One surgeon I consulted with prior to my UPMC consultation indicated they didn‚Äôt like to perform this surgery on any one over age 60. L
  So I was relieved to consult with UPMC. I trust Dr. Bartlett‚Äôs judgment, and am so impressed with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. They are one of the best hospitals in the country, and on the cutting edge of technology. Therefore, when I search the web for info, I first consult UPMC to see what they have to say about any given procedure. So several references below my name are from UPMC and NIH and may serve as a starting point for your inquiry regarding Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (IP). 
  Since recovering from my surgery in July of 2013, I had enjoyed a good state of health until June of this year, 2015. Severe abdominal distress akin to childbirth happened on two occasions. I visited the Emergency room twice. My oncologist said that the pain I was describing to him was most likely symptomatic of Intestinal blockage. So after a PET/CT scan showed several new tumors and ‚Äúincreased nodularity along my intestinal wall‚Äù, I began a second series of chemo treatments of Carboplatin & Taxol, and completed my last session on September 25, 2015. I am scheduled for a CT exam to show final results, but an interim CT scan showed a reduction in my CA 125 count and a lessening in the size of the tumors. My treatments were given via my medi-port once every 3 weeks for a series of 6 treatments. 
  And yes, once more my hair fell out. (No big deal, it will grow back!) I just told my husband that there were some good things about being bald. I can ride down the road with the windows down, and not worry about the wind messing up my hair. It also saves him 15 minutes every time he has to take me somewhere because I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcomb‚Äù my hair. It began to fall out two weeks after the first treatment. The side effects of TAXOL were hair loss, among more serious side effects. I save money on hairdressers too. For Halloween, I can always put on hoop earrings and masquerade myself as ‚ÄúMR. CLEAN!‚Äù I believe that laughter is a part of the recovering and coping process and it puts those around me at ease. I‚Äôm not making light of this cancer, but I am not living in the den of despair either. The peace that God gives me allows me to live with and above the circumstances, and for that I am so thankful.
  Well, ‚Äúmyl‚Äù this serves as my ‚ÄúHello greeting.‚Äù And below are my references that will give you an idea of what Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy is all about. Both HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) as well as IP (Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy) is explained. As for your husband not liking to hear you talk about ‚Äúrecurrence‚Äù, he may not like it but you are the one living in this very ‚Äúreal world‚Äù of potential recurrences. But he is hurting in his own special way. I always said, ‚ÄúWhen my husband has cancer, I have cancer.‚Äù So your husband‚Äôs love for you may cloud his perspective shall we say? No husband, or wife, for that matter, wants to think too far into the future about the difficulties that cancer brings. ‚ÄúTODAY‚Äù your husband is not ‚Äúlosing‚Äù you, and he wants it to stay that way. I can understand that. However, you are wise to be realistic about it all and yet not let it rob you of the joys you share together TODAY! 
  As for your question‚Äî‚ÄúCan you tell me, with that marker, (8.0) how long it usually takes for it to return?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think there is one definitive answer to that question. I believe that depends on each individual‚Äôs case. Anything below 35 is considered in a normal range, as I understand it. My CA125 was never higher than 200 and is now down to 21. But as for ‚Äúthings to come‚Äù, I ask the Lord to give me HIS peace for today, and not let me ‚Äúdwell‚Äù on the things ‚Äúdown the road‚Äù that may or may not occur. 
  Yes, some of these entries are ‚Äúeye openers‚Äù as to how our sisters are suffering. It is wise to research this cancer. But for now, with Stage IV, I have enough to deal with one day at a time. And for the foreseeable future, I hope to have some more good days. Living ‚Äúdays to come‚Äù before they arrive will produce nothing but despair, and rob us of the special relationships we have with our loved ones in the ‚Äúhere and now.‚Äù This letter comes with a special prayer that you will have many good days for a long time to come.
 Loretta
 P.S. These are references you might want to research. You can read them and expand your own personal research of course. But as you read them, remember that TODAY is where you are right now. I am so glad you are doing well at the moment. Don‚Äôt miss it. After reading them, put this info on the back burner of your mind and don‚Äôt go there till you have to. J
  Incidentally, I make no pretense here. Parts of these references I can understand when I read them, and parts are way ‚Äúabove my paygrade.‚Äù However, I have often printed out references and taken them to my oncologist and asked him to explain it to me. You might want to do the same. The distinction between the heated treatment (HIPEC) and (IP), as I understand it, seems to be that the ‚ÄúHyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy‚Äù is administered during the surgical procedure, before adhesions have had a chance to form. (It is a heated chemo treatment.) This provides a better penetration of the tumors. But please ask your doctor for a professional opinion, and as always, anything you read on these discussion links should be discussed with your doctor. Patients are encouraged to share their experiences, but not to ‚Äúprescribe treatments‚Äù. 
  The Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (IP) is administered at various times through a port in the abdomen, and can take a long time to administer. And its effectiveness will vary depending on the size of the tumors and whether or not the patient‚Äôs condition warrants that type of treatment. It doesn‚Äôt seem to penetrate large tumors so effectively. But this is just MY understanding and I am not a doctor. Since it is the weekend, I cannot ask my oncologist. However, if my understanding is not correct, I will come back and clarify things. I did talk to Dr. Sugarbaker‚Äôs office but they were not as encouraging as was UPMC. My age was one factor. However, they said they would ‚Äútake a look at my records‚Äù before making a determination as to whether I was a good candidate for their type of treatment. That‚Äôs when I called UPMC, and they were very receptive to my plight.

  ‚Äú‚Ä¶Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a rare type of cancer that occurs in the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that covers abdominal organs and surrounds the abdominal cavity. The disease develops when cancers of the appendix, colon, ovaries or other organs spread to the peritoneum and cause tumors to grow‚Ä¶Some patients who have peritoneal carcinomatosis as a result of appendix cancer, peritoneal mesothelioma, colon cancer or ovarian cancer that has spread may be candidates for cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. Primary peritoneal carcinoma, which originates in the peritoneum, may also be treated with the procedures.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIntraperitoneal (IP) Chemotherapy for Gynecologic Cancer - Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is a regional chemotherapy procedure in which surgeons insert a port in your abdomen to deliver chemotherapy. Because the chemotherapy is confined to your abdomen, side effects to healthy tissue are minimal.
  IP chemotherapy may be an ideal treatment for gynecologic tumors if they are: Confined to the abdomen or Too advanced to remove surgically
 Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemoperfusion (HIPEC) - HIPEC circulates heated chemotherapy through your abdomen, raising the temperature to between 105 and 107.6 F (40.6 and 42 C). Heating the chemotherapy can increase the penetration into the layers of the cells in the abdomen‚Ä¶‚Äù

  ‚ÄúIP Chemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer - About This Treatment - Intraperitoneal, or IP chemotherapy, is a treatment for ovarian cancer where chemotherapy is put inside your abdomen. This treatment may or may not be combined with chemotherapy that is given in your vein (IV). A port will be placed under your skin and over your ribs to give this chemotherapy into your abdomen. During an IP chemotherapy treatment, you will lie flat on a bed while chemotherapy runs into your abdomen over a few hours‚Ä¶‚Äù

  ‚Äú‚Ä¶Our gynecologic oncologists have used IP chemotherapy since 1995 to treat patients on an outpatient basis. In the past, IP chemotherapy was hard for women to tolerate, and only 40 percent of them completed it. At UPMC, our physicians have made modifications and improvements that diminish side effects, enhance a woman‚Äôs quality of life, and enable 90 percent of patients to finish their therapy.

  ------------------------End of References-------------------",october 10 2015 dear myljon3 since reading your entry i decided to look up some references regarding the intraperitoneal chemo treatments i am addressing this letter to you in particular but decided to put it on a separate entry so others could access the info as well if they are not familiar with it anyone anticipating surgery or having just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer or peritoneal carcinomatosis may find it useful i was first diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis in november of 2012 first i went to my regular gp thinking i might have a hernia since i felt a small lump on the left side of my abdomen he just examined my abdomen with a touch of his hands and concurred that it was most likely had a hernia he asked if i wanted to just wait a while and see if things improved before i could answer he said i can tell by the look on your face that you dont want to wait so he made arrangements for me to see a surgeon however a week later i experienced some sharp groin pain and general abdominal discomfort that lasted for 3 days so i went to the emergency room after going through the routine questions and examination they gave me a ct the physician handed me a copy of my ct scan since my husband is a 15year survivor of esophageal cancer stage iii 3n1m0 that is a miracle for which we thank the lord i immediately recognized familiar cancer terms bottom linemy symptoms were actually cancernot a hernia the doctor showed me my scan on a computer screen and pointed out multiple tumors floating around in the peritoneal fluid in my abdomen from there i began an informative search on the web to find out what this cancer was all about since my husband had successful surgery with the latest laparoscopic procedure for esophageal cancer mie we contacted his surgeon dr james luketich chief of thoracic surgery at the university of pittsburgh medical center upmc for advice and a second opinion he in turn referred me to his associate dr david bartlett we sent my records there and made an appointment for possible exploratory surgery in december 2012 at that time a petct scan revealed that the cancer was also in my ovaries moreover the tumors were too large and too numerous to do cytoreductive surgery at that time i was told to come home undergo chemotherapy treatment and then another consultation would be in order so my chemo treatments of carboplatintaxol began the early part of 2013 thankfully the tumors were reduced to an operable level so surgery took place at passavant hospital one of many hospitals at the university of pittsburgh medical center on july 1 2013 for anyone who has had cytoreductive surgery no explanation is necessary i should say that at age 36 and i am now 76 i had a hysterectomy but only my uterus was removed my ovaries and fallopian tubes were left intact my gynecologist told me recently that many physicians now believe that ovarian cancer actually begins in the fallopian tubes so from now on he is going to remove everything when he performs a hysterectomy in hindsight i would concur with that completely take out everything so if you know anyone who is contemplating having a hysterectomy they might want to consider having everything removed anyway my doctors at university of pittsburgh medical center upmc concluded that most likely this cancer began in my ovaries and then spread to the peritoneal fluid in my abdomen sometimes the primary cancer isnt determined before it shows up in the peritoneal fluid so now i just go by the diagnosis ovarian cancer stage iv and yes thats terminal at some point but my times are in the lords hands and i am making the best use of doctors and medicines he has blessed us with here in america needless to say after the cytorductive debulking surgery was performed i was completely wiped out perhaps i should have said cleaned out doctors said they would remove nonessential organs with that they removed my gall bladder spleen ovaries fallopian tubes omentum and resectioned my intestines had i had an appendix that would have been removed as well but i had appendicitis at age 12 so that saved me one snip when going into surgery i fully expected to have the hipec chemotherapy as part of my surgery we had discussed it as a possibility not until i came out from under the effects of the surgery did i know that dr bartlett opted not to perform the additional chemo treatment naturally i wasnt going to ask for a doover j i went in trusting his judgment and am content to be in as good a shape as i am today however other patients that i met while there did have the cytoreductive crs surgery plus the hipec treatment so obviously it isnt a given that each patient will be treated the same i am certain that the specific diagnosis and the condition of the patient will determine the treatment process moreover i was happy to be eligible to be a surgical candidate at age 74 one surgeon i consulted with prior to my upmc consultation indicated they didnt like to perform this surgery on any one over age 60 l so i was relieved to consult with upmc i trust dr bartletts judgment and am so impressed with the university of pittsburgh medical center they are one of the best hospitals in the country and on the cutting edge of technology therefore when i search the web for info i first consult upmc to see what they have to say about any given procedure so several references below my name are from upmc and nih and may serve as a starting point for your inquiry regarding intraperitoneal chemotherapy ip since recovering from my surgery in july of 2013 i had enjoyed a good state of health until june of this year 2015 severe abdominal distress akin to childbirth happened on two occasions i visited the emergency room twice my oncologist said that the pain i was describing to him was most likely symptomatic of intestinal blockage so after a petct scan showed several new tumors and increased nodularity along my intestinal wall i began a second series of chemo treatments of carboplatin taxol and completed my last session on september 25 2015 i am scheduled for a ct exam to show final results but an interim ct scan showed a reduction in my ca 125 count and a lessening in the size of the tumors my treatments were given via my mediport once every 3 weeks for a series of 6 treatments and yes once more my hair fell out no big deal it will grow back i just told my husband that there were some good things about being bald i can ride down the road with the windows down and not worry about the wind messing up my hair it also saves him 15 minutes every time he has to take me somewhere because i dont have to comb my hair it began to fall out two weeks after the first treatment the side effects of taxol were hair loss among more serious side effects i save money on hairdressers too for halloween i can always put on hoop earrings and masquerade myself as mr clean i believe that laughter is a part of the recovering and coping process and it puts those around me at ease im not making light of this cancer but i am not living in the den of despair either the peace that god gives me allows me to live with and above the circumstances and for that i am so thankful well myl this serves as my hello greeting and below are my references that will give you an idea of what intraperitoneal chemotherapy is all about both hipec hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy as well as ip intraperitoneal chemotherapy is explained as for your husband not liking to hear you talk about recurrence he may not like it but you are the one living in this very real world of potential recurrences but he is hurting in his own special way i always said when my husband has cancer i have cancer so your husbands love for you may cloud his perspective shall we say no husband or wife for that matter wants to think too far into the future about the difficulties that cancer brings today your husband is not losing you and he wants it to stay that way i can understand that however you are wise to be realistic about it all and yet not let it rob you of the joys you share together today as for your questioncan you tell me with that marker 80 how long it usually takes for it to return i dont think there is one definitive answer to that question i believe that depends on each individuals case anything below 35 is considered in a normal range as i understand it my ca125 was never higher than 200 and is now down to 21 but as for things to come i ask the lord to give me his peace for today and not let me dwell on the things down the road that may or may not occur yes some of these entries are eye openers as to how our sisters are suffering it is wise to research this cancer but for now with stage iv i have enough to deal with one day at a time and for the foreseeable future i hope to have some more good days living days to come before they arrive will produce nothing but despair and rob us of the special relationships we have with our loved ones in the here and now this letter comes with a special prayer that you will have many good days for a long time to come loretta ps these are references you might want to research you can read them and expand your own personal research of course but as you read them remember that today is where you are right now i am so glad you are doing well at the moment dont miss it after reading them put this info on the back burner of your mind and dont go there till you have to j incidentally i make no pretense here parts of these references i can understand when i read them and parts are way above my paygrade however i have often printed out references and taken them to my oncologist and asked him to explain it to me you might want to do the same the distinction between the heated treatment hipec and ip as i understand it seems to be that the hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is administered during the surgical procedure before adhesions have had a chance to form it is a heated chemo treatment this provides a better penetration of the tumors but please ask your doctor for a professional opinion and as always anything you read on these discussion links should be discussed with your doctor patients are encouraged to share their experiences but not to prescribe treatments the intraperitoneal chemotherapy ip is administered at various times through a port in the abdomen and can take a long time to administer and its effectiveness will vary depending on the size of the tumors and whether or not the patients condition warrants that type of treatment it doesnt seem to penetrate large tumors so effectively but this is just my understanding and i am not a doctor since it is the weekend i cannot ask my oncologist however if my understanding is not correct i will come back and clarify things i did talk to dr sugarbakers office but they were not as encouraging as was upmc my age was one factor however they said they would take a look at my records before making a determination as to whether i was a good candidate for their type of treatment thats when i called upmc and they were very receptive to my plight 1 sugarbaker oncology associates specialty section for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal and ovarian cancer

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/297329/struggle-with-doctor,"Hi
 I am 39 and have been having abnormal bleeding (July I bled for 7 days, off ten and then 7 more. August no period. September I started on the 18th and ran until October 4th and started again on October 8th. my normal is three days once a month) as well as bloating, abdominal pain, extreme exhaustion and needing to go to the bathroom more frequently. I have had three ultrasounds that show I have several fibroids and a cyst on each ovary. None of these masses seem to be very large. I just have that feeling that something else is at play here. I was able to get a CA 125 which came back as normal 17. My GP happily stated that meant I didn't have cancer even though the note on the results state that this doesn't diagnose cancer or elimitate the possibility either or.
 My second gynecologist states that the problems I am having have nothing to do with the fibroids and that I don't have any symptoms of ovac. She also says that there wouldn't be anything to do a biopsy on. I tried to go around her and go straight to MD Anderson or a local gynecologist oncologist but they won't see me without a diagnosis or a doctor referral. At this point I just want a Biopsy done to determine if it is ovac or is not. Any suggestion on how to convince my doctor to do this? She didn't even think that my fibroids warranted removal even though it is affecting my job and quality of life.
 I'm scheduled to see her tomorrow. 
 I've sort of been on medical leave from my job for a month today. My doctors won't stand in the gap (GP or gyno) while I insist on getting this taken care of and physically in turmoil. They state that the time off for fibroids isn't a proper response. Don't want to lose my job while getting someone to do the very basic diagnostic in this disease. 
  Thanks for for your time.

As a caregiver for my 53 yr old mother, I was wondering if any of you have received intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP)? My mom was diagnosed with UPSC stage IVb (fluid in lungs) in late July, had a radical hysterectomy Aug 3, followed with IV chemo on cycle 1 then they decided to just change it to IP chemo for cycle 2? Both chemo options were very hard but the IP has completely wiped her out. Doctor said studies claim IP chemo is more effective for UPSC & certain ovarian cancers. However, the side effects are much more extreme (now on 5th day ok debilitating fatigue, nausea) so we have an appointment next week to talk about going back to IV through the arm or maybe IP with a lower dosage. Not sure yet! I would appreciate any advice from anyone who has had IP chemo.

 I didn't want to be Debbie downer, so please consider this a semi-motivational post.
 I have been in the second recurrence of high-grade ovarian cancer, originally diagnosed 3 years ago. After an easy year on the PARP-inhibitor trial I was very reluctant about more chemo and had my heart set on another clinical trial, that has been delayed. It took me 6 months of procrastinating and cancer spreading into stage 4 to finally agree to try single agent Carboplatin, only to find out after 1 round that I was allergic. 2 rounds of Cisplatin didn't work either and CA125 climbed to 2600 at which point palliative care doctor gave me 3 weeks to live and recommended hospice. Physically and emotionally I was drained, angry and ready to go.
 In the last ditch attempt another doctor suggested Cisplatin / Taxol combo and I agreed. 1 round (on July 20th) did me in. I was vomiting non-stop for 2 weeks, couldn't eat or drink, lost 50 lbs, lost all electrolytes, all blood counts dropped to the floor. After several trips to ER by ambulance with paralysed hands and feet, BP drop to 50, suspected heart and kidney failure, gallons of IV fluids, black and blue arms (of course I never bothered with the port), multiple ascites draining and other lovely experiences, I'm happy to say that ""the reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated"". The date on the calendar I had marked with skull and crossbones has come and gone.
 As of today my CA125 dropped to 1283, I eat, drink, walk straight, drive and look almost human (with the wig and a lot of makeup). New selfie was taken today.
 I will probably switch to weekly Taxol or Doxil, that remains to be seen when blood counts stabilize.

 My Mom was diagnosed with Stage 3c (Ovarian)+Stage 1a (Endometrium) cancer in May, 2014 at an age of 64.
 She underwent a ‚ÄúPrimary debulking‚Äù (huge operation) in May, 2014 ; with an ileostomy bag connected to collect stool.
 Underwent First Line of Chemo [CarboPlatin + Paclitaxel] from June ‚Äì Oct, 2014.
 She then underwent an ‚Äúileostomy‚Äùreversal operation (to remove the bag connected earlier) on Jan 29, 2015 ; where the Docs found Cancer still spreading in mesentery (abdomen); and did another secondary de-bulking.
  After this, she is currently on a Second Line of Chemo (LipoDox), already given 2 cycles; and 3rd cycle tomorrow IST.
  Decission :
 Now our doc has given us an option to also add Avastin (Bevacizumab), along with the current Lipodox.
 They call it as a ‚Äútargeted‚Äù therapy that binds/targets a protein (VEGEF) that is required in New Blood Vessel formation; which in turn slows down the tumor from growing or can shrink it. It is also said to increase the efficacy (may be side effects too) of the Chemo Med too.
  We are confused as :
 1. This is newly approved for recurrent Ovarian cancer by FDA (In Nov. 2014).
 2. Clinical Trials data shows a Grade 4 side effects in upto 3% patients (leading to fatality too) to Intestinal perforation.
 3. There are other Grade1/2 side effects too in upto 20% patients. (i.e. which can be controlled thru other meds).
 4. Has to be given almost Life long (or till the patient can tolerate); as there are no current medical guidelines, when to ‚Äústop‚Äù it.
 5. It is pretty costly (that‚Äôs the reason not too popular in India), though this is not an imp. factor.
  [Please excuse me for the percentages mentioned above, as they are a very rough no. that I remember!] 
 Since, our doctor has given that as an ‚Äúoption‚Äù sharing all the possible side effects; we are pretty confused how to move forward.
 It seems like a gamble at this stage.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/295581/trying-to-understand-whats-going-on,"My mother (64 years old, non-smoker, non-drinker) has not yet been diagnosed but it is presumed to be ovarian cancer stage III. In the beginning of the year she had a rash on her thigh and it was noted as being a UTI and got treated for it. After two months she began to lose weight and was tested for H.Pylori and it came back positive. She was placed on antibiotics for 2 weeks, we waited another week. She continued to lose weight, so the doctor ordered for a biopsy to be done within her stomach.
 The oncologist took a CT scan right away and planned to do the biopsy the next day. The CT scan showed fluid/mass in between her pancreas, liver and gallbladder. We were told the chances of it being cancerous was highly likely (5/29). Kaiser scheduled a nuclear endoscopy on the 6/19 to obtain a biopsy, it was a difficult position thus the higher end endoscopy procedure was necessary.
 We then had a meeting with a gynecologic oncologist 6/3 who talked to us further on the findings of the CT scan and tumor markers. Cysts were present on both ovaries, tumor markers were CA-125 - 66, CA19-9 - 3,000, CEA - 3.3. She stated that she was going more toowards this as being a GI, she set up a transvaginal ultrasound and a PET scan. The ultrasound was conducted on 6/4 and the PET on 6/12. Her findings were inconclusive on the ultrasound and stated she felt the ovaries were in good condition and was moving towards it being GI. In the meantime we have family that are radiologist and a family friend that is a lead in GI oncology at MD Anderson in Houston. They claimed they saw nothing out of the norm and her blood tests for liver functions and every test that is capable were in good standing. The only thing they did see were gallstones and a little inflammation in the bile duct but nothing to alarm about.
 After the PET scan was conducted my mom had abdomnal pain 6/14 and we rushed her to the emergency room. They took x-rays and CT scans and saw multiple tumors in the omentum and tumor of 5 cm in the small bowel mesentery and saw inflammation in the small bowel calling it an obstruction. We learned of the results from the PET scan as coinciding with the CT scans and had lymphnodes that had lit up as well. Kaiser took biopsy samples from the abdomen to find out the origination, but it was only determined to be adenocarcinoma and the origination was not found. We stayed in the hospital until 6/19 and had TPN installed to help out in getting calories to increase her weight and get her strength up (lost 30 lbs at this point).
 In the meantime a biopsy was done for the first mass that was identified on the first CT scan. The doctor took a sample and claimed he also saw nothing out of the norm through the GI and had a sense this was coming from the ovaries. During our stay many doctors had told us they felt it was ovarian, but our gynecologic oncologist was leaning towards it being GI. At this point we became scheduled with Kaiser Los Angeles and we were moving on as if it was ovarian. The lead doctor (Dr. Lentz) is an amazing doctor and I would highly refer to him if you belong within the Kaiser system, he connects with his patients and will readily speak to other doctors within the family to discuss further in detail of what is happening. He is very hopeful of the response and treatment plan for my mom, he wants to do chemotherapy and wants to help her build up her strength for surgery. Many doctors were claiming the cancer to be stage IV unoperable, Dr. Lentz had no doubt it being Stage III and stated with how the cancer has moved and progress he feels it is ovarian but wants to take a larger biopsy sample within the abdomen to verify the origination. The reason for another biopsy is because the biopsy of the original mass speculated to be cancerous came back negative and not cancerous.
 On 7/2, we started chemotherapy a Taxol and Carboplatin regiment (3 weeks for 1 cycle). After the second treatment 7/9, my mom felt stronger pain in her abdomen so we rushed her to the emergency room. They took a CT scan and saw no change (possible smaller size) on the tumors compared to a CT that was done on 6/14, but this time they saw no inflammation / blockage in the small intestine. Her lymphnodes in her arm pit have also gone away at this point, and her white blood cell count for neutrophils has also come back from being very high to normal levels. Even with chemotherapy her other white blood cell counts have been very stable in the normal range and all of her other blood tests have been coming back normal as well, except for the liver function test due to TPN, but have come down to normal as well, because she has started to eat and drink again. It looks like she is going through some pains from the chemotherapy now but has morphine to control the pain and reglan for nausea, antacid seems like it also helps as well. We are now set to have the next biopsy done on 7/28 and hopefully will have more answers then questions at that point.
 My question to the people here is, do you believe the inflammation / blockage within the intestines was related to cancer or an infection (lymph nodes have gone away too)? Also, after almost 4 weeks between CT scans and two treatments is it a good sign that the tumors so far have held to their size.
 We will be getting CA-125 results as we have had two already, 66 (5/29) and 77 (6/25).

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/294881/scheduled-tah-on-june-11-re-scheduled-due-to-magnesium-citrate-pre-op-but-changing-my-decision,"Hello,
 I have been lurking on many ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and hysterectomy websites for a while now since my ob-gyn recommended a hysterectomy last month.
 I have been battling severe endometriosis for 13 years now. I am turning 43 next month and I have accepted that I will not be able to bear a child of my own. My ob-gyn prescribed birth control pills and Lupron. I decided not to take birth control pills because of my desire to have children. I tried Lupron once but I developed severe allergic reactions to it. Aspirin and acetamipophen are the only pain medications that have helped me endure the pain for 13 years. In between, I had a LEEP procedure done about 6 years ago due to pre-cancer cells on my cervix and two laparoscopies. My mother died of ovarian cancer and a younger sister had a LEEP procedure done as well. Two of my sisters have children of their own.
 Two months ago, I had my routine PAP smear, ultrasound, and my CA-125 taken. The first CA-125 was elevated so my ob-gyn requested another one in 3 weeks. The second drawing of blood yielded another elevated reading. My latest laparoscopy was last October and cancer was not detected. From that time on, I noticed that I gained weight and my abdomen bloated all of a sudden. I have been experiencing intermittent night sweats, too. My ob-gyn recommended a TAH due to my elevated CA-125. When I asked him what my ovarian cancer risk is, he said that it is low. 
 So I went to see the gyn-oncologist that my ob-gyn recommended. When I saw her, she did not really look at my history. Her office just scheduled me for the TAH which was supposedly last Thursday. Due to the magnesium citrate that kept me in the bathroom until yesterday and blood in my stool (I apologize.), I called the gyn-oncologist and hospital to cancel the surgery and re-scheduled it.
 However, I have been reading many sources and I came to the conclusion that I need a PET-CT scan first to confirm whether I really have ovarian cancer. Both doctors have not found cancer in my system yet but they decided that I undergo a TAH right away. My intuition is telling me that I have to confirm first if I am really sick of cancer before I choose to remove my diseased reproductive organs.

 Thank you.",hello i have been lurking on many ovarian cancer endometriosis and hysterectomy websites for a while now since my obgyn recommended a hysterectomy last month i have been battling severe endometriosis for 13 years now i am turning 43 next month and i have accepted that i will not be able to bear a child of my own my obgyn prescribed birth control pills and lupron i decided not to take birth control pills because of my desire to have children i tried lupron once but i developed severe allergic reactions to it aspirin and acetamipophen are the only pain medications that have helped me endure the pain for 13 years in between i had a leep procedure done about 6 years ago due to precancer cells on my cervix and two laparoscopies my mother died of ovarian cancer and a younger sister had a leep procedure done as well two of my sisters have children of their own two months ago i had my routine pap smear ultrasound and my ca125 taken the first ca125 was elevated so my obgyn requested another one in 3 weeks the second drawing of blood yielded another elevated reading my latest laparoscopy was last october and cancer was not detected from that time on i noticed that i gained weight and my abdomen bloated all of a sudden i have been experiencing intermittent night sweats too my obgyn recommended a tah due to my elevated ca125 when i asked him what my ovarian cancer risk is he said that it is low so i went to see the gynoncologist that my obgyn recommended when i saw her she did not really look at my history her office just scheduled me for the tah which was supposedly last thursday due to the magnesium citrate that kept me in the bathroom until yesterday and blood in my stool i apologize i called the gynoncologist and hospital to cancel the surgery and rescheduled it however i have been reading many sources and i came to the conclusion that i need a petct scan first to confirm whether i really have ovarian cancer both doctors have not found cancer in my system yet but they decided that i undergo a tah right away my intuition is telling me that i have to confirm first if i am really sick of cancer before i choose to remove my diseased reproductive organs i will meet with the gynoncologist this monday to suggest to her about the petct scan if she does not agree i have already spoken with another hospital for a second opinion i am interested of your thoughts your enlightenment and words of wisdom will go a long way thank you,"Lupron, Aspirin, acetamiphen",Yes,Moderate,"severe allergic reactions, gained weight, abdomen bloated, intermittent night sweats, blood in my stool",abdomen bloated

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/293362/not-getting-any-treatment,"It was September 13, 2014. I had been in the emergency room since 9:00pm the night before. After going through many tests, I got the diagnosis at 5:00am. I was told that I had end stage terminal ovarian cancer that spread to my liver and spleen. The doctor wanted to admit me to the hospital. From how it sounded, he did not think I had much time left to live. My husband suggested that we go home, get some sleep and pray. We got a little sleep and then went to see our pastor. I suddenly realized that only God knows when I will die and if the doctor was thinking I was close to death anyways, only a miracle from God was going to save me. My husband and I discussed it and decided against treatment and surgery and instead decided we would trust the Lord to treat me. Hospice was called in and they are such a blessing. Hospice does not get called in unless the doctor believes you have 6 months or less to live. Most of my family did not understand the decision to not have treatment, but they have since come around. I have been through blood clots, which I briefly used blood thinner injections for. Between all of the fluid built up in my stomach and losing 32 pounds in 32 days, the injections caused me more pain than the blood clots had. The other problem with that was that part of the clot moved to my right lung causing breathing problems. I decided to then trust the Lord with that too. I have also had a build up of fluid in my stomach. Originally my husband took me to the emergency room everytime fluid needed to be drained. Someone then mentioned the PluerX catheter. My husband and I decided that it was a good idea. I went to the hospital to have it inserted in my stomach. The surgery itself was not explained to me much at all. I thought it would be similar to the procedure to have the fluid removed at the hospital. The doctor that was putting it in had done the fluid removal for me before. He highly recommended that I get an IV for pain medicine. I reluctantly did and I was glad. I was awake through the whole surgery, which was pretty painful. It was an outpatient surgery so the doctor sent me to the recovery room I got to the recovery room at about 2:00pm and was told I could go home at 5:00pm. I had taken 2 Tylonol#3 during those 3 hours and they did nothing for the pain. At 5:00pm I tried to sit up so I could go home. It felt like my stomach got a cramp that would not ease at all. The nurse let me stay in the recovery room a while longer. With the excrutiating pain I was in, the drive home was aweful. When we got home, getting up to go to the bathroom was horrible. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but to me, on a scale of 1-10, my pain level was 15. It took 24 hours before my pain became more tolerable. At that point, the pain was reduced by half, thankfully. I did not notice much difference in the pain in the next 24 hours. After 48 hours the pain level was constantly getting bettet. I am glad that I did not know how painful it would be because I may not have gotten it done. Now, I love it because my husband and I can easily drain the fluid in the comfort of our home. I had so much fluid built up, that it went into my legs. This made it very difficult to walk, as well as uncomfortable. We started draining the fluid 3 times a week. We drained 2 liters of fluid everytime for 3 weeks. As we drained the fluid from my stomach, the fluid in my legs started going down too. Now we only need to drain around 3 liters of fluid a week. Aside from around 2 months of pain in more than 6 months, I have been very comfortable. Not long after being diagnosed, I became vegan. I was struggling to get enough protein, so I realized that it was not right for me. Although having so many servings of fruits and vegetables each day made me feel great. Not long ago, I got back to some of the old bad eating habits and I notice that I do not feel as good as I did when I was eating a healthy and balanced diet. For me, eating healthy has been a good alternative to traditional treatment. I tell people often that if God heals me here, I win and if He takes me home I win. All I can say is that this diagnosis has been a true blessing to me and I have seen many answered prayers because of it. My faith and positive attitude have made a big difference in my experience with terminal cancer. I am sure everyone has a completely different experience or outcome, but this is what is working for me. I choose to live life to the fullest, knowing that God could take me home anytime. My husband and I are planning to renew our weddingvows this November, believing I will still be alive and well then. When it cones to how long any of us will live following a terminal caner diagnosis, doctors can only make their best guess, based on what they have seen and read about other patients with the same diagnosis. I refuse to believe that I only have a short time left to live. One of the hospice nurses made an interesting comment, saying ""we are all born terminal"", ""therefore we will all die simetime"".

 I completed 3 radiation treatments (targeted) to the brain about 3 weeks ago. Even prior to my seizure and all that mess, I was struggling with my appetite. Now it's really bad. I have had to eliminate dairy as it was causing nausea and vomiting. Spicy foods are out and tomato based foods seem to bother me.
 
 I've eaten applesauce until I'm almost tired of it. I'm doing okay with soft scrambled eggs. I am eating some peanut butter crackers. I am also struggling with drinking enough fluids.
 
 Also, I want to sleep a lot. I have been on continuous chemo for over 3 1/2 yrs. I am to begin a new one this Wednesday. (Can't remember the name of it). 
 
 I'm just so tired and frustrated!! Any suggestions? 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Carla

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/293488/strategies-for-dealing-with-cisplatin,"I certainly don't recally why I chose the name ""zenmama"" when I joined this board way back way. Must have been wishful thinking. Or maybe more positive thinking at the time. Anyway, I don't feel very ""zen"". 
 Does anybody have any experience and tips for coping with Cisplation? I have had many rounds of Carboplatin, which I did not find fun, but marginally tolerable in retrospect now, and Taxol I can deal with (I have been fortunate in that my neuropathy has stayed in the realm of numbness and clumsiness and not pins/needles/pain). I have been taking Emend and Zofran and Maxran (or Metonia or something - the nurses call it Maxran) for naseua, so that isn't the problem. It is overwhelming mental distress and inability to eat anything - fortunately I can still drink water). I get Taxol by itself two weeks out of three and then Cisplatin added on the first of the three-week cycle (since I had a reaction to Carboplatin I can't be treated with it it any longer), and it feels lik all hell breaks loose. I can't even focus on a movie, and certainly not a book or magazine.
 I saw somebody on the board that had been treated with cisplatin for years. I have had three treatments and am on the verge of telling my doctor that I can't do any more. And she had told me after my first treatment that the dose I was getting wasn't all that high! That I shouldn't even need the Emend (the nurses told me to ask her for it).
 My mind has been in some dark places over the past three days since my treatment, and I am at my wits end. I actually found myself feeling envious of a couple of obituaries I read thinking that those souls were over the worst. At the same time that I am so looking forward to winter being over and good weather and want to live!! This drug is crazy-making for me! I am almost equally afraid of giving it up in case it is what is working!
 I do take an anti-depressant (with the exception of the couple of days when I don't feel like swallowing anything)!
 This is my third recurreance, stage IIIC diagnosis 13 years ago, so I have been very fortunate and have done very well up to now - got through the first two recurrences without any issues, so very, very fortunate. This darn cisplatin!!

Treatments for the past several months have been a little tough to take, but sometimes I think that as we continue year after year every treatment will be tougher. Diagnosed in November 2011 with 3c. I've had pretty much all the standard chemos for our disease plus 26 rounds of chemo. The last two were topotecan and gemsar, which as alexandria once said are pretty ineffective by themselves. Biggest problem to date is ascites. Have to get between 3 and 4 liters drained about every 5 days. They sent the fluid to a testing lab in Pittsburgh and it listed several chemo treatments which may be effective, one of which is etoposid You take 3 pills for 4 days every month. Has anyone ever used this chemo and did it help at all? They are hoping it will either dry up the ascites or at least cut production. Right now I'm recovering from what they call a Y90 procedure. They go up thru your groin and put radioactive spheres in any spots on your liver. Anyone had this done? They say it is a fairly new but seems to be quite effective. Side effects are extreme fatigue and nausea. Chemo doctors are pushing to take the pills, but radiation doctor says wait 3 weeks at least to get over Y90. They never seem to agree. Testing of ascites fluid showed topotecan and gemsar would do no good. There are 5 or 6 listed that should help. We will see. Anyone else had any succces with testing?

For three years I have had minimal problems except general fatigue. (Except for Doxil, which nearly killed me for 6 weeks, but that is another story!)
 Recent developments: In January 2015, I stopped Topotecan because my CA125 was up to 226 and the scan showed more progression. In fact I had a Ureteral stent placed in Feb for hydronephrosis, as a tumor was collapsing the ureter. It is not comfortable. I feel the urge to urinate CONSTANTLY and I experience bladder spasms every time I do urinate. in the meantime, we have been arguing with the insurance company about what to do next, so I had no chemo for two months. And my CA125 is 460! (Don't forget, the cancer was growing, even with the chemo.)
 During the hiatus, I have developed swelling in my right leg, from the groin down to the toes. I was checked for blood clots, and the blood circulation is fine. It is not particularly painful, but it feels very tight, especially at the ankle and knee. And very heavy. It is about 50% larger than the left leg. My appointment with the lymph edema specialist isn't for two more weeks.
 What do you think? There isn't much on this board about lymphedema. Anyone experience this? It seems weird, so long after my surgery. I just don't know what to expect and would love to hear from others who've dealt with this.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/252487/looking-for-lmp-borderline-oc-members,"Hi,
 I am new to this network and am looking to connect with others with similar situations, experiences and history. As I read through the posts under Roll Call, I didn't see any LMP/Borderline diagnosis listed, and feel uncertain whether to introduce myself there. I feel very blessed and fortunate my cancer turned out to be non-invasive and treatable via surgery and no chemo. From all my research and talking with my gyn/onc it seems there are mixed reviews whether LMP Tumors should be classified as cancer, borderline cancer, precancerous, or benign. I understand also it depends on the pathology testing of the cells and there are various levels within. My oncologist told my husband and me, my tumor was not benign, and if I had been 10 years older, there's a good chance I would have been late stage aggressive cancer. He explained to me the Low Malignant Potential Cancer is fortunately very slow growing and treatable through surgical removal with excellent Prognosis. He explained recurrence chances are low -about 5%, but will want to monitor things closely through ultrasounds and CA125 tests.
 
 About me:
 Age: 36
 Location: Milwaukee, WI
 General Health: Overall good, but about 40 lbs overweight. I try to eat well most of the time and am a regular walker/jogger - 3 miles, 3 times per week. Has a LEEP and Electrcauderization for cervical displaysia (precancerous cells) at age 19.
 Symptoms that led me to see Dr : Bloating and gassy, severe diarrhea spells for 6-9 months
 CA125 Pre-surgery: 105 (have not yet had a post-op test)
 Diagnosis: Stage II Low Malignant Potential Tumor
 Family History: Mom had Cervical cancer at 30 and uterin pollips. No info for fathers side.
 My story:
 Nov 6 I went to a new MD for a general physical, no gyno stuff. I shared what I suspected we're GI problems. the Dr ultimated did an exam of my lower abdomen, she originally though my uterus was enlarged. She set me up with a pelvic ultrasound on the 9th. I could see the tech concentrating on a specific area and taking lots if measurements, but assumed I might have had pollips worst case.
 Fri, Nov 10 my doctor's office called me at work to inform me the Ultrasound showed a 14cm complex cyst on my ovary. The doctor contacted my ob gyn who in turn after review referred me to a gyn/oncologist. She also ordered a CA125 test.
 My CA125 came back at 105, and I met with the gyn/onc the following Wed. He was great! Has a wonderful calm demeanor and allowed me all the time I needed. Becausevof the solid mass visible inthe ultrasound and my CA125, he put my cancer risk at 30%. His plan was to remove the cyst, ovary and tube via laparoscopy. He explained the laparotomy and staging process if he suspected cancer. I was confident with him when I left his office.
 Surgery was Dec 6. Once my GO got in with the scope, he saw the concern and changed my surgery. He informed my husband and parents who were there so they would know the surgery would be longer, and staging would be done. He removed the tumor, right ovary and tube, omentum, 30 lymph nodes and pelvic tissue. I have a incision from about one inch above my naval down to the pubic bone plus 3 tiny incisions -one just below my left ribcage, one at each side above my hips. Final pathology showed the solid mass inthe tumor as borderline cancer, plus borderline cells in one of the pelvic tissue samples. All other test came back neg.
 Forward plan: I see the GO on Jan 14. After that, I will see him every 3 months plus have a CA125 test and ultrasound. If good, will stretch to biannual tests, and of good from there to annual tests.
 
 So, I'm 4 1/2 weeks post op and feeling more and more normal everyday. I have overdone it resulting in some setbacks, but doing well.
 
 Going forward, I want to make serious changes to my lifestyle to prevent recurrence, and other health issues.
 
 I also want to do everything I can to help bring awareness to ovarian and other gynecological cancers. I knew nothing about risks and symptoms before this experience, and feel strongly there needs to be more awareness.

 http://www.chiro.org/nutrition/Nutrition_Archives.shtml#Iron_Too_Much_of_a_Good_Thing
 Recent studies reveal that blood donors exhibit lower rates of many diseases and experience better than average health. Additionally, the centuries-old practice of bloodletting is being revived as a treatment for disorders such as heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's. [ 1 ] Why would blood reduction improve health parameters? In part, because blood removal helps to control circulating iron levels.
 
 Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin in red blood cells, is associated with strength, and is required for oxygen transport, DNA synthesis and other processes. But it also has a destructive nature. In its free form, unbound from hemoglobin or other binding proteins, it accelerates oxidation or ""rusting"" of body tissues. Since iron-induced oxidation worsens the course of virtually every disease, iron control could be a universal approach to disease prevention and therapy. [ 2 ]
 
 Whereas poor iron intake, or impaired absorption, may lead to anemia, too much iron‚Äîiron overload‚Äîis even more problematic. [ 3 ] After full growth is achieved, at about age 18 or so, excess iron accumulates in the blood of all humans at the rate of 1 mg per day. [ 2 ] About 80 percent of the body's iron stores are in the blood. Women are less at risk for iron buildup than men because of the blood they lose monthly during menstruation. As a result, women have somewhere around half the circulating iron levels as men. Their rates for heart disease, cancer and diabetes are also about half those of males. Because men have no direct outlet for iron, by age 40 their iron levels are similar to those of a postmenopausal 70-year-old woman. This amount of iron can lead to premature aging and diseases such as arthritis, cancer, cataracts, diabetes, osteoporosis, and retinal, liver and brain disorders. [ 4 ] Postmenopausal women, or women who have undergone early hysterectomy in their 20s, 30s and early 40s, may experience similar problems. [ 5 ]
 
 Recognizing The Problem
 
 Iron overload hasn't gone completely unnoticed. There are a number of books on the topic, but most are written for health professionals, leaving the public largely unaware of the problem. Also, some confusion exists regarding the role of iron in health and disease. First, there is a mistaken idea that the majority of the people affected by iron overload diseases have the genetic form, called hemochromatosis, which affects only about 1 million of the estimated 275 million Americans. In fact, the potential threat of iron overload is universal. It comes with advancing age and regardless of genetic factors. Second, the emphasis on preventing anemia in children and menstruating women has detracted attention from progressive iron buildup in adult men and postmenopausal women. [ 6 ]
 
 Upon closer inspection, many health-promoting practices inadvertently control iron. For example, taking an aspirin a day to prevent heart attacks and strokes causes blood loss via the digestive tract on the order of about a tablespoon per day. This results in iron loss. [ 7 ] Raymond Hohl, M.D., an assistant professor of internal medicine and pharmacology at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, says even chronic use of a baby aspirin may help to control iron and in some cases can induce iron-deficiency anemia. [ 8 ] Aspirin also appears to increase the production of ferritin, an iron-binding protein that prevents iron from inducing oxidation. [ 9 ] By exercising, a person loses about 1 mg of iron through sweat. [ 10 ] Fasting and vegetarian diets, both of which promote longevity in animals and humans, limit iron consumption because red meat contains the highly absorbable heme iron. Whether or not related to iron consumption, restricting red meat consumption has been shown in various studies to reduce the risk of colon cancer. [ 11 ]
 
 Normal Iron Regulation
 
 In healthy individuals there is little if any unbound iron circulating in the blood. In all disease states, however, unbound iron (also called free iron) is released at sites of inflammation and can spark uncontrolled oxidation. [ 12 ] Fortunately, there are numerous automatic mechanisms in the body that help to control iron, many by chelation‚Äîcompounds that bind to a toxic substance (such as iron) and render it nontoxic or nonactive. Albumin, a simple protein found in blood, acts as a chelator by loosely binding to iron. [ 13 ] Ferritin, produced in the liver, is another iron-binding protein. [ 14 ] Transferrin is a protein that chelates iron and totes it back to the liver, where it is metabolized and excreted. [ 15 ] The liver produces lactoferrin, another iron chelator, when challenged by infectious agents. [ 16 ] This is important because pathogenic organisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi require iron for growth. Furthermore, as iron stores increase, the gastric absorption of iron decreases. So the body employs numerous mechanisms to control iron that are activated when threatened by disease. However, these defensive mechanisms can be overwhelmed.
 
 Blood tests for iron levels (i.e., hemoglobin and ferritin levels are checked for transferrin saturation percentages) are often useful, but the results of these tests are confounded in states of prolonged inflammation or disease. [ 17 ] A skilled hematologist is often the best professional from whom to obtain personal information concerning blood iron levels.
 
 Differentiating between anemia and iron overload can be difficult because both conditions cause fatigue. One study at the Department of Medicine, University of Western Ontario in Canada, found that iron overload can produce a wide range of symptoms, such as joint pain (particularly hip), unexplained gastric pain, frequent infections, skin bronzing, elevated liver enzymes, cessation of menstruation, hair loss and heart flutters (fibrillation). Yet, of 410 iron-overload patients, 27 percent experienced no symptoms whatsoever. [ 18 ] Common symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia are lowered resistance to infections, fainting, breath holding, mental fatigue, sleepiness, cold hands and feet, and cravings for ice, meat or tomatoes, all which are more likely to occur among women. [ 19 ]
 
 Dietary Iron Control
 
 Various dietary practices can help control iron levels. In a relatively short period of time, dietary changes can result in anemia, iron overload or an ideal state of iron control. Anemia can be induced in about 120 days, while symptoms of iron overload can come on in just 60 days.
 
 Humans absorb only a fraction of the iron they consume, but there are many controlling factors. [ 20 ] Iron absorption rates from food vary widely, from less than 1 percent to nearly 100 percent. [ 21 ] Cooks who use iron or stainless steel pots increase the amount of iron they consume. [ 22 ] Generally, iron in plant foods is not as well absorbed as iron from meat: Only 5 percent of iron in plant foods is available, vs. 30 to 50 percent of iron from meat. [ 23 ] Olive oil and spices such as anise, caraway, cumin, licorice and mint promote iron absorption, [ 24 ] while antacids, eggs and soy reduce availability. [ 25 ] Since dairy products contain lactoferrin, milk also inhibits the absorption of iron. [ 26 ] Moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to pose a problem with iron absorption, but excessive amounts of alcohol is associated with iron overload, particularly in adult males. [ 27 ]
 
 Vitamin C also increases iron absorption. [ 28 ] However, there is no evidence that vitamin C leads to iron overload. Thus vitamin C should not be avoided by meat-eaters for this reason, since studies show high-dose vitamin C supplements are associated with a decreased risk for heart disease, cancer, cataracts and other disorders. [ 29 ] A vegetarian diet does not generally cause iron-deficiency anemia because there is more vitamin C in plant-food diets, which enhances absorption. [ 30 ]
 
 A 1982 human study was conducted to assess the effect of various drinks on iron absorption. A subject ate a standard meal of a hamburger, string beans, mashed potatoes and water. When green tea was drunk instead of water, iron absorption was reduced by 62 percent. Coffee reduced iron absorption by 35 percent, whereas orange juice (as a source of vitamin C) increased absorption by 85 percent. Contrary to other studies, milk and beer had no significant effect. [ 31 ]
 
 Bioflavonoids (found in berries, coffee, green tea, pine bark, quercetin and the rind of citrus fruits, particularly blueberry, cranberry, elderberry and grape seed) and phytic acid (a component of whole grains and seeds such as sesame) bind to iron and other minerals in the gastric tract and help to limit iron availability. If bioflavonoids and phytic acid haven't bound to minerals in the digestive tract they will get into the bloodstream, where they can bind to free iron, acting as blood-cleansing iron chelators. Therefore, maximum iron chelation in the blood circulation is achieved when these iron binders are consumed apart from meals.
 
 Phytic acid‚Äîalso called inositol hexaphosphate, or IP6‚Äîis comprised of six phosphorus molecules and one molecule of inositol. It has been mistakenly described for decades as an ""anti-nutrient"" because it impairs mineral absorption. However, in the 1980s food biochemist Ernst Graf, Ph.D., began to tout phytic acid for its beneficial antioxidant properties achieved through mineral chelation. [ 32 ]
 
 Phytic acid in foods or bran should be distinguished from supplemental phytic acid, which is derived from rice bran extract. In foods, phytic acid binds to iron and other minerals in the digestive tract and may interfere with mineral absorption. As a purified extract of rice bran, taken between meals so it will not bind to minerals in the digestive tract, phytic acid is readily absorbed into the bloodstream, where it acts as a potent mineral chelator. [ 33 ] Phytic acid binds to any free iron or other minerals (even heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium) in the blood, which are then eliminated through the kidneys. Phytic acid removes only excess or unbound minerals, not mineral ions already attached to proteins.
 
 Phytic acid is such a potent‚Äîbut safe‚Äîiron and mineral chelator that it may someday replace intravenous chelation therapy such as the mineral-chelator EDTA or iron-binding drugs such as desferrioxamine (Desferal). Because of its ability to bind to iron and block iron-driven hydroxyl radical generation (water-based) as well as suppress lipid peroxidation (fat-based), phytic acid has been used successfully as an antioxidant food preservative. [ 34 ]
 
 Phytic acid supplements should not be taken during pregnancy since the developing fetus requires minerals for proper development. Because aspirin causes a small loss of blood and consequently helps to control iron levels, the simultaneous use of phytic acid with a daily aspirin tablet is not advised. A three-month course of phytic acid should achieve adequate iron chelation, and prolonged daily supplementation may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Anemic individuals who take phytic acid as a food supplement are likely to feel weak shortly after consumption, whereas iron-overloaded individuals are likely to feel increased energy.
 
 For those at risk for iron overload, it may be wise to avoid iron in multivitamins and shun fortified foods that provide more than 25 percent of the recommended daily intake for iron. No doctor should prescribe iron tablets for patients who complain of fatigue without blood tests and a thorough health history. Iron-rich foods such as red meat and molasses may prevent anemia and build strength during the growing years but in adulthood may lead to iron overload among men and postmenopausal women. Those individuals who learn how to achieve iron balance will maintain the most desirable state of health throughout life.
 
 This is information you should ideally be getting from your doctors, as cancer just loves iron and copper for that matter. It hates potassium.

ferritin levels are checked for transferrin saturation percentages are often useful but the results of these tests are confounded in states of prolonged inflammation or disease 17 a skilled hematologist is often the best professional from whom to obtain personal information concerning blood iron levels differentiating between anemia and iron overload can be difficult because both conditions cause fatigue one study at the department of medicine university of western ontario in canada found that iron overload can produce a wide range of symptoms such as joint pain particularly hip unexplained gastric pain frequent infections skin bronzing elevated liver enzymes cessation of menstruation hair loss and heart flutters fibrillation yet of 410 ironoverload patients 27 percent experienced no symptoms whatsoever 18 common symptoms of irondeficiency anemia are lowered resistance to infections fainting breath holding mental fatigue sleepiness cold hands and feet and cravings for ice meat or tomatoes all which are more likely to occur among women 19 dietary iron control various dietary practices can help control iron levels in a relatively short period of time dietary changes can result in anemia iron overload or an ideal state of iron control anemia can be induced in about 120 days while symptoms of iron overload can come on in just 60 days humans absorb only a fraction of the iron they consume but there are many controlling factors 20 iron absorption rates from food vary widely from less than 1 percent to nearly 100 percent 21 cooks who use iron or stainless steel pots increase the amount of iron they consume 22 generally iron in plant foods is not as well absorbed as iron from meat only 5 percent of iron in plant foods is available vs 30 to 50 percent of iron from meat 23 olive oil and spices such as anise caraway cumin licorice and mint promote iron absorption 24 while antacids eggs and soy reduce availability 25 since dairy products contain lactoferrin milk also inhibits the absorption of iron 26 moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to pose a problem with iron absorption but excessive amounts of alcohol is associated with iron overload particularly in adult males 27 vitamin c also increases iron absorption 28 however there is no evidence that vitamin c leads to iron overload thus vitamin c should not be avoided by meateaters for this reason since studies show highdose vitamin c supplements are associated with a decreased risk for heart disease cancer cataracts and other disorders 29 a vegetarian diet does not generally cause irondeficiency anemia because there is more vitamin c in plantfood diets which enhances absorption 30 a 1982 human study was conducted to assess the effect of various drinks on iron absorption a subject ate a standard meal of a hamburger string beans mashed potatoes and water when green tea was drunk instead of water iron absorption was reduced by 62 percent coffee reduced iron absorption by 35 percent whereas orange juice as a source of vitamin c increased absorption by 85 percent contrary to other studies milk and beer had no significant effect 31 bioflavonoids found in berries coffee green tea pine bark quercetin and the rind of citrus fruits particularly blueberry cranberry elderberry and grape seed and phytic acid a component of whole grains and seeds such as sesame bind to iron and other minerals in the gastric tract and help to limit iron availability if bioflavonoids and phytic acid havent bound to minerals in the digestive tract they will get into the bloodstream where they can bind to free iron acting as bloodcleansing iron chelators therefore maximum iron chelation in the blood circulation is achieved when these iron binders are consumed apart from meals phytic acidalso called inositol hexaphosphate or ip6is comprised of six phosphorus molecules and one molecule of inositol it has been mistakenly described for decades as an antinutrient because it impairs mineral absorption however in the 1980s food biochemist ernst graf phd began to tout phytic acid for its beneficial antioxidant properties achieved through mineral chelation 32 phytic acid in foods or bran should be distinguished from supplemental phytic acid which is derived from rice bran extract in foods phytic acid binds to iron and other minerals in the digestive tract and may interfere with mineral absorption as a purified extract of rice bran taken between meals so it will not bind to minerals in the digestive tract phytic acid is readily absorbed into the bloodstream where it acts as a potent mineral chelator 33 phytic acid binds to any free iron or other minerals even heavy metals such as mercury lead and cadmium in the blood which are then eliminated through the kidneys phytic acid removes only excess or unbound minerals not mineral ions already attached to proteins phytic acid is such a potentbut safeiron and mineral chelator that it may someday replace intravenous chelation therapy such as the mineralchelator edta or ironbinding drugs such as desferrioxamine desferal because of its ability to bind to iron and block irondriven hydroxyl radical generation waterbased as well as suppress lipid peroxidation fatbased phytic acid has been used successfully as an antioxidant food preservative 34 phytic acid supplements should not be taken during pregnancy since the developing fetus requires minerals for proper development because aspirin causes a small loss of blood and consequently helps to control iron levels the simultaneous use of phytic acid with a daily aspirin tablet is not advised a threemonth course of phytic acid should achieve adequate iron chelation and prolonged daily supplementation may lead to irondeficiency anemia anemic individuals who take phytic acid as a food supplement are likely to feel weak shortly after consumption whereas ironoverloaded individuals are likely to feel increased energy for those at risk for iron overload it may be wise to avoid iron in multivitamins and shun fortified foods that provide more than 25 percent of the recommended daily intake for iron no doctor should prescribe iron tablets for patients who complain of fatigue without blood tests and a thorough health history ironrich foods such as red meat and molasses may prevent anemia and build strength during the growing years but in adulthood may lead to iron overload among men and postmenopausal women those individuals who learn how to achieve iron balance will maintain the most desirable state of health throughout

Apparently I had intended to take a shower. I had a seizure. I lost 2 days of my life.
 
 That was Friday, Scans from a couple of weeks had shown that I had one lesion on the stem of the brain. Thankfully, the MRI showed that was the ONLY spot. I meet the radiologist tomorrow. It's possible I'll start radiation later this week. I also meet with my oncologist on Friday.
 
 When I had my seizure, I bit my tongue on both sides. Has anyone else had this happen? My dr. was thrilled with me this morning. He had told my Dad that I could respond just as quickly. My Dad also told said that Dr. Sullivan was so very sad and upset. I had heard from his receptionists had told me that when he delivered bad news he was so upset.
 
 Does anyone have any suggestions for helping my tongue heal? I am also bruised on my back, chest, arms.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/291899/new-questions-about-symptoms-appt-w-gyn-onc,"Hi everybody. I have history of endometriosis (including cysts & an endometriomas) without ever having elevated ca125. Last 3 ultrasounds showed persistent complex mass on left ovary (with some growth, but not substantial) and smaller one on right. I am hoping it is another endometrioma yet an MRI showed septations I think they were called. Ca125 is at 100. The left ovary has been giving me lower persisitent pain. I still have periods, but not sure what they are doing as of late. During the past year, I skipped one period. One period was 17 days. Now I am having a period after just having one 2 weeks ago. Also, for well over 2 months, breasts have remained painful. (Mammogram was ok and not pregnant and never have been able to conceive.) 
  So, I have a million questions while I wait 2 weeks go get into the gyn onc office. How many of you had pain in the specific area of the ovary? How many menstruating women began having irregularities as a possible symptom?
  I don't know what the best course of action is. I think my regular gyn indicated that the gyn onc would prob be taking the left ovary and doing frozen sections? But isn't there more definitive tests, so that if it was just another large endometrioma--couldn't I just have it ablated? Why all of a sudden am I supposedly having it removed? Just because of the ca125 and the mri? Kind of confused. Well, as I said I don't for couple of weeks, but I will post and update and appreciate any guidance you all can offer.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/291249/planning-for-the-future,"Sorry about this long post. I am trying to organize my thoughts by putting them on ""paper"".
 Quick recap:
 I am BRCA+, diagnosed OVCA 3C in May 2012, had optimal THBSO, 7 rounds of IV Carbo/Taxol. After 9 months remission recurred in Sep. 2013, refused more chemo, no treatment for 8 months. Since Apr. 2014 been on PARP inhibitor (Rucaparib) trial, it worked well for 8 months but now my CA125 is going up (141), however my last CT scan was still clear.
 Objective:
 To buy more time by finding another clinical trial as easy and effective as PARP. There are no trials currently available in Canada for platinum-sensitive recurrent OVCA. Trust me, I checked and checked again. Having been on one PARP disqualifies me from all other PARP trials.
 Yesterday I met with my ONC. He promised to keep me on the trial drug for now in hopes of it slowing progression down. He claimed that it could be months till the beginning of symptoms and was reluctant to discuss other trials. However based on my own analysis of CA125 behavior and historic data I have a more conservative prognosis and estimate that symptoms (abdominal pain and ascites) will return around end of February - beginning of March. Which leaves me 2 - 2.5 months to come up with the treatment strategy. So being a control freak, I am back to the drawing board; if you don't do it yourself, no one will do it.
 Best case scenario - new trial:
 There is one trial (NCT02326844) in Bethesda, MD testing PARP inhibitor BMN673 (Tolazaparib) after the failure of other PARP inhibitors. It's a viable option but requires travel and raises a common sense question: why would BMN673 be any better than similar drugs of other pharma companies?
 There is a phase 1 trial (NCT01609556) of I MGN853 for FOLR1-positive tumors, but enrollment is on hold worldwide for some reason.
 But there is something in the pipeline that I am excited about. If PARP inhibitors increase PFS and VEGF inhibitors (anti-angiogenics) increase PFS, shouldn't they work even better as a combo? They tested this hypothesis in phase 2 trial (NCT01116648) of PARP (Olaparib) and VEGF (Cediranib ) together and it seems to be true - 18-19 month PFS for both BRCA- and BRCA+ respectively. Both drugs are taken orally and have unpleasant but manageable side effects (fatigue, diarrhea and hypertension). http://www.healthcanal.com/cancers/ovarian-cancer/55059-drug-combination-delays-worsening-of-disease-in-women-with-recurrent-ovarian-cancer.html
 The good news - two phase 3 trials of Olaparib / Cediranib combo sponsored by NCI / NRG Group are coming to town in early 2015 for both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. There is no trial number and date yet. Yesterday night I emailed lead investigators and I am still waiting for their reply. Now I am keeping my fingers crossed for this new trial to start enrolling patients soon. I have enough energy and chutzpah to insert myself into the investigative arm of this trial by any means necessary. I just might not have enough time.
 Worst-case scenario - chemo (well, next to worst):
 If I can't find a suitable clinical trial in time, I have to consider chemo. I don't want it, but it beats ... the other worst-case outcome. I am still platinum-sensitive. The standard option would be Carbo/Taxol. I hate Taxol with a passion (peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, etc.). Another options are Carbo/Gemzar (affects blood counts) or Doxil (Caelyx). Carbo/Doxil is a good combo but difficult to obtain in Canada. Avastin has not yet been approved in Canada and is not covered by insurance. Gemzar and Topotecan as single agents are weak and unlikely to work.
 Short-term plans:
 Not to let this stuff get to me. Have as much quality of life as possible. Ignore negative people. Get my makeup, hair and nails done. Eat chocolate ice cream. Buy a new purse. Race my car. Watch every new movie. Hang out with friends. Go to Vegas. Go to Jamaica. Live. 
  I wish everyone a Happy and healthy New Year! I hope to see all of you on the board in 2015.

I have no known risk factors i.e. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, overweight, family history, race, etc. except my age,74. I've been pondering this and wondered if it could be related to my ovarian cancer treatment almost 17 years ago. I had 6 treatments with taxol and cisplatin. The last three were also administered through the abdomen (paritoneally). I finally googled kidney disease and cisplatin and on the National Cancer Library I found the following:
 
 ""Kidney disease is a common side effect of cisplatin. The risk of this side effect increases with higher doses and the longer you are treated with the drug. Your healthcare provider will give you fluids before your treatment and may ask you to drink extra fluids after your treatment to protect your kidneys.""
 
 I guess that answers that. Now my question is: Is it likely to remain constant or continue to worsen?

My GFR, Bun Creatinine ratio have been relatively constant (GFR around 42). I'm grateful I survived the ovarian cancer with no recurrences but would like more information.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/289507/newbie,"Hi,
 I am new here and glad to have found this messageboard. I was diagnosed on july 31 of this year with OC. I thought I had a bowel blockage so i went to the er. To my surprise and thiers, I had a ovarian tumor the size of a grapefruit. I had been very bloated and just not feeling well. That night my mother passed away in the nursing home she was in.
 Saw one woman surgeon who was horrible, so I called my gp, and he and my gyn got me into Womens and Infants in Providence RI. I live in Connecticut.With some strong insistence, I also got the best surgeon. Debulking and 7 days in the hospital....early stage 3. Recovery as you all know is tough. When I went back to see my surgeon, he told me he wanted me to try something called inter-peritoneal chemo, as welll as reg chemo 1 session. It hasn't been too bad except for the overwhelming fatigue. Little neasea, headaches, some belly pain. I am grateful no vomiting. 17 treatments under my belt.
 Anyone here undergoing IP, or have gone thru it??? Of course I have depressed and anxious, as I had these before. Lots of support from family and friends, and husband, but, somehow unless you've gone thru it, you just don't understand. My husband has been great, but yet I feel he just can't really understand what I am going through. This morning I feel weak and just feel like crying. Most of the time I keep very positive. Am glad to have found all of you.

Needless to say my onc wants me back on chemo as soon as possible but I'm concerned with constipation issues and laxatives. have an appointment with gastro guy on Thursday looking for advice.

 I've had a pleasant few months on Gemzar. It gave me absolutely no side effects except tiredness/fatigue. Unfortunately, it was not giving my cancer a hard time, either! So, tomorrow, I start Doxil. 
 I am surprised at the level of anxiety I am feeling, because I have read many posts about the nasty side effects. I've been on chemotherapy for 2 1/2 years, but except for losing my hair, I haven't had any bad side effects. Oh, yes, I have the chemo brain, and minimal tingling in my toes, and nausea/vomiting every few weeks, and I'm tired all the time, but nothing really bad or intolerable. I haven't missed work except for appointment days. But Doxil scares me!

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/287563/mixed-results,"My mother had her CT scan last week and we finally got the results today, which were not that encouraging but could have been worse. The scan shows that most of her tumors have remained around the same size. The only one that grew was the one they initially thought was a cystic tissue but now appears to be a tumor. We were disappointed because the treatment is very hard on her. She has bilateral plueral effusion around both lungs and a plurex catheter on the right side. Due to the shortness of breath she has not been able to go anywhere other than the hospital and could barely move from one room to another. She is on oxygen, though she started to feel better after the catheter was implanted and the left cavity drained. She has also started taking lasix to help remove the fluid from around her lungs and we believe that is working. It is still unclear wheter or not this is a function of her cancer, which it could be, as this and previous scans showed that it had spread to the plueral cavity; or if it is a side effect of the doxil which the website says is a possiblity. It is also posibile that it is partly both, we just are not sure and the doctors tell us there is no way to find out for certain. I suppose we will know more at her next treatment. My mother decided today that she will try two more treatments of the trial and see what happens since the one bright spot was that her ca-125 levels had dropped again about 800 points; which was encouraging. Unfortunately, we did not get this information while still in the hospital, because I really wanted to know how her tumors had grown or stayed the same but her ca-125 levels were down. Tommorrow we go over to the pulmenary lab to find out when or if she can ever be taken off the oxygen, which she hates.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/286730/need-ideas-for-supplements-asap-please-help,"Greetings, this is my first post here. I am looking for support/ideas. My mother-in-law was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 3 years ago. They removed her ovaries and she has been doing chemo on and off. There was a time she was cancer-free but then it came back with a vengeance. She had to suspend chemo for a while due to complications (pulmonitis) and then low white blood count and this is when things went really down hill and she developed an agressive tumor to her liver and now is spreading to the breast. They tried more rounds of stronger chemo, but things got so worse and the chemo stopped working. She has ascitis (swollen abdomen) since then and they removed as much fluid as they could but now they are giving up and saying there's nothing left to drain and she's swollen from the cancer. My mother-in-law is in Italy, and my husband is going to see her soon, as sadly doctors are saying there is nothing left to do and she may only live 2-3 months. So it may be a sad goodbye, but hope never dies. I have a week to purchase some supplement abroad and have my husband bring to her. I cannot make up my mind what to bring her. Debating over Essiac tea, artemisinin, colloidal silver, turmeric/bromelein or flaxseed oil to try with cottage cheese. I know this is a tough question, but we're at the point where I guess nothing is lost trying. She is on pain medicine (morphine), and at home in the country, she has no resources to rely on--no internet, no libraries. So I feel like they just left her to die at home without giving her any options. It's very sad and I can't stop thinking that perhaps there's something worth a try. Any help is greatly appreciated.",greetings this is my first post here i am looking for supportideas my motherinlaw was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 3 years ago they removed her ovaries and she has been doing chemo on and off there was a time she was cancerfree but then it came back with a vengeance she had to suspend chemo for a while due to complications pulmonitis and then low white blood count and this is when things went really down hill and she developed an agressive tumor to her liver and now is spreading to the breast they tried more rounds of stronger chemo but things got so worse and the chemo stopped working she has ascitis swollen abdomen since then and they removed as much fluid as they could but now they are giving up and saying theres nothing left to drain and shes swollen from the cancer my motherinlaw is in italy and my husband is going to see her soon as sadly doctors are saying there is nothing left to do and she may only live 23 months so it may be a sad goodbye but hope never dies i have a week to purchase some supplement abroad and have my husband bring to her i cannot make up my mind what to bring her debating over essiac tea artemisinin colloidal silver turmericbromelein or flaxseed oil to try with cottage cheese i know this is a tough question but were at the point where i guess nothing is lost trying she is on pain medicine morphine and at home in the country she has no resources to rely onno internet no libraries so i feel like they just left her to die at home without giving her any options its very sad and i cant stop thinking that perhaps theres something worth a try any help is greatly appreciated,"morphine, artemisinin, colloidal silver, turmeric, bromelein, flaxseed oil, Essiac tea",Yes,High,"pulmonitis, low white blood count, ascitis, swollen abdomen",none
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/285032/its-been-awhile,"Hello everyone, it's been awhile so I figured I would check in. It's actually been about 2.5 months give or take! I made a post back in May freaking out about the possibility of cancer. My doctor reffered me to a gyn and I wasn't able to get in until June 9th. On June 9th the doctor I visited did not do any furture testing at all. She said that based on syptoms it sounded like I polycystic ovarian syndrome. I was gave birth control. I go back to that doctor on the 19th at 9:45 am. She said at this time she will be doing a new ultrasound and ct scan with contrast. (same as the did in the ER) While I am waiting as patiently as possible I am losing my mind and having new issues. I still feel pain on and off, I have only had 1 period in the last 3 months, mild pain during intocourse, I still feel sick a lot of the time, I get constant headaches, lack of appitite, lack of energy and more recently bright red blood in my stools. (sorry TMI)
 Yesterday I went to my regular doctor she was very angry that they haven't already done new ultrasounds,ct scans or blood work but was happy to hear they will be doing that on the 19th. My reg doctor said that she was going to reffer me to a geneticist for testing to see if I carry the cancer gene. I guess they will be testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. I am still unsure what it will mean if the test comes back positive.
 My Moms doctor told her that she carries that gene. This sept is her 5 yr mark from where she was battling breast cancer. She also recenlty had a mini stoke that put a blood clot at the front of her head. My mom was 46 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Also, my grandmother had breast cancer and ovarian cancer. I am not sure what age she was when she was diagnosed. I do know she was only in her mid 60's when she passed away 4 years ago.
 I still feel like I have no answers. The one doctor said polycystic ovarian syndrome but that was without actually looking at any documentation. ( she didn't look at the ct scan results or the ultrasound results the hospital did) she just based her diagnoses on what information I was giving her.

 ""I'm beginning to realize how lucky I've been in the past with the severity of the side effects I've felt with the two other chemo combos I've been on. (Does that even make sense?!). I had Taxol/Carbo, and a huge amount of Gemzar/Carbo, and never once was I rendered unable to function. But this Doxil/Carbo has taken me by surprise. I've had two treatments so far. The queasiness, burning skin pain all over my body, painful heaviness in my legs, is not going away in 3-4 days like with the other combos. I try to accomplish one meaningful task each day, but all I really want to do is crawl back into my bed/nest. I'm going to Seattle on 7/17 to a favorite cousin's memorial service. (Died in June of colon cancer. His death hit me hard, because I was suddenly socked in the gut with my own mortality). I am really looking forward to seeing lots of family, but am terrified of feeling too crappy to enjoy the celebration, so I have to figure out a way to rally. I've already gotten the 3rd treatment put back a week because of this trip, so maybe that'll help. Just writing all this down has helped already! Thanks, everyone. Too bad I can't give you all the hourly fee you deserve!""
 Since I wrote this, I do feel a bit better, but the symptoms come and go without warning. My chemo nurse said what I am describing is very typical of Doxil side effects. She will talk to the doc and suggest maybe lowering the dose for my next treatment on 7/28. I'd love to hear anyone else's experience with Doxil, positive or negative.
 Meanwhile, have a safe and relaxing 4th of July.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/284080/waiting-for-results,"Hi everyone.
 
 My dad is dying of prostate cancer right now. He was ""fine"" (no noticable symptoms) in February of this year. But week by week after that, he got worse and worse. He visited the Emergency Room no less than 8-10 times and they kept sending him home, saying it was nothing. One urology resident actually said ""relax, it isn't cancer! If it were cancer we'd take you right in!"" When he finally saw a urologist two months later, they said then and there that it was cancer, and that it was aggressive and that it was terminal. He has maybe a few months left, a year if we're really lucky. It was a shock to all of us. He's only 70.
 
 Meanwhile, in the past few months I've been experiencing a wide range of symptoms that I've been brushing off as nothing, but last week it all came to a head; I was asked by my mom to go get myself checked out because she saw that the things I was complaining about were maybe connected; strange, copious discharge, minor spotting between periods, extremely heavy flow during periods with a lot of pain when I never used to have any; minor pelvic aching all the time (I just figured it was ovulating or something) and minor pain when I'd use the washroom during my period. I went to my doc yesterday and she said my uterus ""felt full"" (and boy was it tender when she touched those ""full"" places on either side of my pelvis!) and sent me immediately for pelvic ultrasound and a complete blood count. Got those done today. Ultrasound tech obviously didn't tell me much, but she said that she saw a ""small fibroid"" at first, and then looked a little more and then asked when my last period was, and am I having very heavy periods, and is there a lot of pain? I said yes, and she didn't say anything else. Now I'm terrified. I'm only 36, with two small children. I haven't told anyone what I'm afraid of because there's already so much stress and worry about my dad, I don't want to add to anyone's fears, or look stupid for being worried.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/266428/time-for-reflection,"Its hard to believe that we started this journey only 6 months ago, it seems like years have gone by. My arling wife of 37 years (as of a couple of weeks ago) went to the emergency room with a pain in the tummy and vomiting and was admitted. Over the next 4 days all sorts of scans and tests were done leading the surgeon to believe it was gallstones. He asked a retiring gynocologist to assist with a laperoscopy eamination where some marks were detected on her right ovarey, a section f the bowell and her perritoniel lining plus some discolouration of the omentum. The gall bladder was enlarged and they decided to leave it alone and send Beth for treatment of ovarian cancer. Beth was admitted as an outpatient to the gynocology oncology unit at a Melbourne hospital a couple of hours away. 2 weeks after the laporoscopy we were in the unit for the first of 6 treatments using carbo/taxol. The first treatment went without any hitches with Beth feeling quite sick after 3 days. During the second treatment Beth had a reaction to the drugs, After a short break in administering the drugs it was restarted and she finished a little later than expected. Unfortunately she suffered some pain similar to the reaction after 4 days and had a panic attack. Some diazapan and all was well. We went for a scan after round 2 and had round 3 after which we talked with the surgeons about a debaulking surgery 4 weeks after round 3. A blood test the week before showed her plate levels were to low so a transfusion was needed before we headed back to Melbourne. Surgery day arrived and we were expecting some major surgery but when the surgeon opened her tummy all the spots they were looking for had dissapeared and the surgeons now believed thet the spots found earlier were secondary to a tumor in the gall bladder. The tumor in the gall bladder had been misread as gallstones but had been shrunk by 2/3 with the treatments. After further discussion with the surgeons and medical oncologists it was decided to keep up with the original treatment plan and monitor for future patient treatment. The next treatment was a week before christmas and unfortunately christmas eve was another 7 hours spent in emergency recieving a potassium infusion. The first treatment of the new year went well and we thought we could get thru without the few sickly days but unfortunately while taking a shower Beth feeling a bit dizzy and sat on a chair and fainted. Another trip to the emergengy room and some fluids given and home for a few days of rest. On wednesday we head down to Melbourne for the last round and in a way we are looking forward to it. Over the time we have seen the ca125's drop from 260 down to tier current level of 4. We really cant thank the staff at our local hospital and those at the unit in Melbourne enough. The unit is a specialist oncology unit that only treats 6 ladies each of the 3 days they operate, it has been a very personal and comfortable enviorment.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/275367/its-been-a-while-19-y-o-stage-4,"I've had a lot going on lately, so I haven't been able to make it back to these boards in a while, but it's been on my mind and I wanted to update you all on my progress.
 I don't remember what all I said before, I think the last I checked in was around the time I was having my breasts biopsied. So I'll do a quick recap. 
 I was first diagnosed in August 2013, after going to a few different emergency rooms complaining about severe stomach pains. Finally I was admitted and scheduled for surgery... They thought my gall bladder had burst. Gynocologist came in and said, whoaaa, hold your horses. I think she has cancer instead. So they do an exploratory surgery instead and biopsy a bunch of crap and come to find out, they say it's stage 3C ovarian cancer. They schedule me for chemo. I complain about a lump in my breast. I'm told that it's probably benign. They do a biopsy of my breast. It's the ovarian cancer. So now apparently that means I'm stage four.
 Anyways, the chemo didn't work. Since my cancer isn't an aggressive kind, apparently it's a sort of double ended sword, because while it won't kill me as fast as aggressive forms, it's harder to treat because since the cells don't multiply so fast, it's sort of invisable to the chemo. At least that's how I understand it.
 So now they have me on some experimental studies. My last CT Scan showed basically no difference in the abdominal tumors (some had stayed the same, some had grown, some had shrunk), however my CA125 decreased dramatically. There was also a lot of fluid built up around my lungs which makes it really hard for me to breathe. They scheduled me to get it all sucked off, which helped for a while, but now I'm back to wheezin' my way up the stairs, and I mean, I'm 19 years old for goodness sake. I shouldn't have to think about the possibility of bringing a wheelchair to Nashville Shores. Then again, I guess I shouldn't have to worry about any of this, but that's life, right?
 Anyways, lately, besides the major breathing problems (I've quit smoking cigarettes, however I continue to smoke pot because it helps me more than all the rest of my prescriptions combined), I've been feeling really awful. I know that they're saying that the treatment I'm on seems to be working, but I still *feel* like I'm dying, if that makes any sense. I have no energy to go anywhere, I can't eat, and when I do eat it usually comes right back up, I have heartburn from hell, I feel so weak, all of the time. Besides my medications, do you guys have any ideas to help put some pep back into my step? I feel so... lethargic and lazy. Also, the weirdest thing is going on with my pubic hair, it's growing in really patchy if that makes any sense, but the hair on the rest of my body is behaving normally. Any idea what could be going on with that? There's also a gigantic rash on my side and on my breasts that I can't seem to do anything about, it's like a constantly open wound, it's painful and itchy and it seems like it's always oozing and gross. Not to mention that my stomach is so swollen that I literally look around 5-6 months pregnant, and now my lower back has been swelling up really badly too (I treat that with a heating pad and my dilaudid). I just want some semblence of normality... This has been going on so long, and I'm so tired of ""fighting"" it, I'm just, SO, *TIRED*.",ive had a lot going on lately so i havent been able to make it back to these boards in a while but its been on my mind and i wanted to update you all on my progress i dont remember what all i said before i think the last i checked in was around the time i was having my breasts biopsied so ill do a quick recap i was first diagnosed in august 2013 after going to a few different emergency rooms complaining about severe stomach pains finally i was admitted and scheduled for surgery they thought my gall bladder had burst gynocologist came in and said whoaaa hold your horses i think she has cancer instead so they do an exploratory surgery instead and biopsy a bunch of crap and come to find out they say its stage 3c ovarian cancer they schedule me for chemo i complain about a lump in my breast im told that its probably benign they do a biopsy of my breast its the ovarian cancer so now apparently that means im stage four anyways the chemo didnt work since my cancer isnt an aggressive kind apparently its a sort of double ended sword because while it wont kill me as fast as aggressive forms its harder to treat because since the cells dont multiply so fast its sort of invisable to the chemo at least thats how i understand it so now they have me on some experimental studies my last ct scan showed basically no difference in the abdominal tumors some had stayed the same some had grown some had shrunk however my ca125 decreased dramatically there was also a lot of fluid built up around my lungs which makes it really hard for me to breathe they scheduled me to get it all sucked off which helped for a while but now im back to wheezin my way up the stairs and i mean im 19 years old for goodness sake i shouldnt have to think about the possibility of bringing a wheelchair to nashville shores then again i guess i shouldnt have to worry about any of this but thats life right anyways lately besides the major breathing problems ive quit smoking cigarettes however i continue to smoke pot because it helps me more than all the rest of my prescriptions combined ive been feeling really awful i know that theyre saying that the treatment im on seems to be working but i still feel like im dying if that makes any sense i have no energy to go anywhere i cant eat and when i do eat it usually comes right back up i have heartburn from hell i feel so weak all of the time besides my medications do you guys have any ideas to help put some pep back into my step i feel so lethargic and lazy also the weirdest thing is going on with my pubic hair its growing in really patchy if that makes any sense but the hair on the rest of my body is behaving normally any idea what could be going on with that theres also a gigantic rash on my side and on my breasts that i cant seem to do anything about its like a constantly open wound its painful and itchy and it seems like its always oozing and gross not to mention that my stomach is so swollen that i literally look around 56 months pregnant and now my lower back has been swelling up really badly too i treat that with a heating pad and my dilaudid i just want some semblence of normality this has been going on so long and im so tired of fighting it im just so tired,dilaudid,Yes,High,"severe stomach pains, breathing problems, no energy, can't eat, heartburn, weakness, lethargy, patchy pubic hair growth, gigantic rash, painful and itchy wound, swollen stomach, swollen lower back, tiredness",none
https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/272798/pole-dancing-in-teal,"My 2 year ""cancerversary"" is in a few days. I was first diagnosed on May 3rd, 2012.
 Physically I am exactly in the same condition as I was 2 years ago. Recurrent cancer is uncontrolled, CA125 is 800+, moderate pain, yesterday I had 4.4 liters ascites drained and as of tomorrow I will be getting daily IV fluids at home in addition to the trial drug.
 Some negative things I aquired in those 2 years: scars, peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, weight gain and menopausal symptoms. Some things I lost: uterus, ovaries, omentum, hair (it grew back), my job (good riddance!), and sense of control.
 Compared to 2012 today I have a new appreciation of life, friends and family, plenty of free time and more medical knowledge. I no longer have job-related stress and BS drama, I don't worry about getting old, I can get away with morbid jokes and most importantly I've met many wonderful people along the way whom I am proud to call my friends.
 I see my progressive L.M.C. (or Low Marble Count) as a defense mechanism: I can't focus on being sad, scared or anxious long enough for it to affect my mood.

I am a registered nurse (women's health) so I'm familiar with this area. I am not familiar with ovarian cancer until I began having some worriesome symptoms. Could anyone please let me know if I'm right to be worried or just overreacting. Here it goes:
 About a year ago I bagan having intermittent left lower pelvic pain that would get better if I sat down for awile. Around this time I also started having low back pain which I just blame on my job. in the last 6 months the back pain has become very very bad. I had a hysterectomy 4 years ago (still have ovaries) so I can't say anything about menstrual changes.
 A month ago I started having daily, severe epigastric pain (indigestion). Not heartburn, more of a painful burning cramping in my upper stomach. I have to take pepcid almost daily for this. Around his time I also began losing my appetite and when I do eat I fill up quickly. In fact it is 3:30 in the afternoon and I still haven't eaten today. I have made something but here it sits untouched because I'm just not hungry. When I do eat it's lik the food just sits in my upper stomach. 
 Two weeks ago the lower left pelvic pain has become more constant and is no longer relieved by sitting. I tend to thnk its from adhesions or cysts but I have the other things going on that makes me think maybe it's not. 
 A few days ago I noticed my stomach not only feels bloated but it looks bloated as well. I measured my stomach and it was 40 cm around, yesterday it was 42 cm and today it is 43. Despite this gain in my stomach area I have begun to rapidly lose weight. I mean RAPIDLY! 7 pounds lost this week. I realize I'm not eating as much as usual but that still seems pretty excessive. 
 So there it is. If anyone could tell me their symptoms and let me know what you think about mine it would be greatly appreciated.",i know worrying about something before there is something to worry about is silly but here i am anyway i am a registered nurse womens health so im familiar with this area i am not familiar with ovarian cancer until i began having some worriesome symptoms could anyone please let me know if im right to be worried or just overreacting here it goes about a year ago i bagan having intermittent left lower pelvic pain that would get better if i sat down for awile around this time i also started having low back pain which i just blame on my job in the last 6 months the back pain has become very very bad i had a hysterectomy 4 years ago still have ovaries so i cant say anything about menstrual changes a month ago i started having daily severe epigastric pain indigestion not heartburn more of a painful burning cramping in my upper stomach i have to take pepcid almost daily for this around his time i also began losing my appetite and when i do eat i fill up quickly in fact it is 330 in the afternoon and i still havent eaten today i have made something but here it sits untouched because im just not hungry when i do eat its lik the food just sits in my upper stomach two weeks ago the lower left pelvic pain has become more constant and is no longer relieved by sitting i tend to thnk its from adhesions or cysts but i have the other things going on that makes me think maybe its not a few days ago i noticed my stomach not only feels bloated but it looks bloated as well i measured my stomach and it was 40 cm around yesterday it was 42 cm and today it is 43 despite this gain in my stomach area i have begun to rapidly lose weight i mean rapidly 7 pounds lost this week i realize im not eating as much as usual but that still seems pretty excessive so there it is if anyone could tell me their symptoms and let me know what you think about mine it would be greatly appreciated,"pepper, not mentioned",Yes,High,"intermittent left lower pelvic pain, low back pain, severe epigastric pain, painful burning cramping in upper stomach, loss of appetite, feeling full quickly, bloating, rapid weight loss",bloating

Bottom of feet and palms of hands were a mass of blisters. Finally after going through jars and jars of Aquaphor the feet and palms are almost completely covered with new skin. I also changed colors from the neck down I am a dark brown color. It is finally peeling and as I walk through the house I leave behind a trail of dry skin. I am getting tired of sweeping the floors. One good thing though I can now become a criminal since my fingerprints were completely burned off. Also my eyes are so watery it is difficult to read. Anybody have a solution to watery eyes I would be grateful if you could post it. I also lost 17 pounds in two weeks I now have a fighting weight of 105 pounds. When I saw the doctor last week he was amazed by my reaction. He understood why I called to get pain meds I do not like taking pills but I had no choice. He said he was trying to kill the cancer with chemo not the patient. My tumor marker wasn‚Äôt that great but he said he was not worried about that since the cat scan was all negative.

I small 3 cm ovarian cyst and a fybriod were found, so they added ibubrophen to the Vicodin and sent me home. The next day I saw my Internal Med. Doc, she changed me to Occy Codone and ordered blood test with a referal tomy gynocologist. 5 days later i saw the gynoclogyst and she said it's nothing OB in her opinion that neither could cause that much pain and sent me back to my Doctor. My doctor had done a CA125 and the gynocologist did not know this at the time the number is 190. So the gynocalled my back saying i needed a D & C with Biopsies immediately, surgery was done 1/15/14. 9 days later she tells me the biopsies are negative, but she wants me to see my doc again and feels my doc should refer my to specialist. They refer my to an gynocoligical oncologist who looked at my tests, CT and then has a surgical nurse call to set up a complete hysterectomy. Every question I tried to ask the nurse told me the doctor would answer at the surgical consult. this isnt until 3/4/14. No-one will tell me why they feel i need a complete hystorectomy. Can anyone help from your knowledge and experience. I live in alaska and my surgery will be done in Wahington which is why i dont see the surgen until the actual surgical consult.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/266582/concerned-tests-now-what,"Hello everyone. I am new here and hoping to get some opinions about some recent tests. Here is a quick timeline of whats been going on. 
 Prior history- Ablation in 2011 to remove endometriosis, ovarian cyst removed, 4 previous abnormal paps. Tubes tied in 2000. No period since 2011. Experienced significant weight loss over the last 3 months. 38 pounds to be exact.
 October 2013- Sudden severe back pain ended me in the ER. Given pain meds and injection. Five days later pain relieved.
 Two weeks later-back in the hospital with more back pain, unable to walk. Lower abdominal and severe hip pain. MRI of neck back and hip all clear. DX with spasms and sciatica (despite clear MRI)
 November 2013- severe bruising and pain through back and legs- sent to rhuematologist who did tons of blood work. All negative except for very low vitamin D levels. Based on pain he DX me with Lupus, Rhuematoid arthritis, fibromyalgia. Gave several meds. Took meds for one week and stopped seeing the dr because I felt dx was wrong and primary agreed. 
 one week later- ER visit for pelvic and back pain. Culture came back negative, Ultrasound showed a cyst on rt ovary. No other abnormalities
 January 2014, had a CT done and showed a liver cyst, the ovarian cyst had grown, umbilical hernia now present, and now possible uterine fibroids. Hernia causing problems so referred to a General surgeon. Appt is this thursday.
 February 2014. Upper and lower abdominal pain still present. US shows cyst is now complicated, several uterine fibroids. Gave me meds for indigestion. Primary sending me to a GYN.
 Should I be concerned that all the sudden medical issues could be cancer? My mother has thyroid cancer, my aunt died of lung cancer, my sister has cervical cancer cells present, and several other cancers run high in my family. 
 I have had cysts most of my life but they come and go or rupture.

 Those of you who've been here since Hissy Fitz and Dorian may remember me. I'm not a whiner or a fatalist. I'm a survivor. But tonight I find myself in need of some prayers and positive thoughts. I've had one recurrence, brain mets in which my Ca125 doubled about every 2 weeks. This year, my CA125 has been creeping up since January. Not anything significant yet, from 12 in Jan. to 28 in Nov. , my oncologist assures me that anything below 35 is normal and nothing to worry about, but it hasn't been stable...only rising.
  On top of that, my husband for almost 15 years told me at the end of May that was leaving me. He tells me he's just not happy, but he's told others it's because after the steroids, brain surgery ,whole brain radiation and gamma knife to eliminate the tumors in my brain that I ""got fat and my hair didn't grow back right."" Ergo, he's not attracted to me anymore. 
 I understand that that is his problem, not mine, but it still adds to the stress in my life. Stress that I don't need, nor do I deserve. I'm seeing a counselor, but I'm not sure I can go through this alone.
  Not asking for solutions, as I don't think there are any, just asking for prayers. I've always found comfort here, from Dorian, Linda, Hissy Fitz and many many others who are still here...hoping to find it again.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/266110/lasting-effects-from-chemo-being-brushed-aside-by-my-oncologists,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer 5 1/2 years ago and recieved chemo (Bleomycin, Cisplatin, and Etoposide) for 4 months then cancer free! Yay!!! However during the treatment i kept asking my oncologist about the increasing numbness in my feet. Each time I asked this question it was as if I didn't speak at all despite my other question being answered. I was frustrated but at the time thought ""ok, well maybe he's just not worried about it"". During the first 6 months of cancer checks I kept asking about this with the same results. Unfortunately at this point my insurance was able to dump me on a technicallity and I was unable to see an oncologist until just past my five year cancer free mark. During this time I found a wonderful dr that helped me get some of my checks and began caring for my increasingly painfully numb feet. We were both waiting for me to get insurance again to see a neurologist and a new oncologist where I now lived. My feet had become horribly painful and the numbess and weakness was moving up my ankle and into my hands by now, becoming worse almost by the week but, finally!, I had insurance again so off to my pain specialist, neurologist, and my new oncologist. Pain specialist basically says really nothing I can do to help stop the progression let alone make it better. Neurologist says same thing and does an EMG of my leg finding no reactions in my feet at all and only a little above that. So...off to my oncologist who I was certain would help to understand more about the lasting effects I was having (chemobrain seems to have only impoved somewhat as well but being a bit of a fruitcake isn't bothering me too much in fact sometimes its amusing). I tell her immediately about the neuropathy and she immediately cuts me off with ""that'll be fine"" I say ""no you don't understand it's getting much worse, I can't...."" ""No, it'll get better"" ""It's getting worse!"" ""It'll get better!"" I gave up after she said this for the fifth time. Apparently my oncologists must know something that my other doctors do not. Meanwhile, I'm starting to fall and drop things often.
 I am only 39 years old and so very happy to be alive and understand that the chemo was the lesser of two evils, I really do! But I have a right to expect the doctors that prescribed these poisons in the first place to help me deal with ALL side effects from them and not just boot me out the door because my cancer is ""cured"". Leaving me alone, scared, and having to learn what I can from kind community health doctors that cared enough to help me research it. 
 Anyone else have similar?
 On a nicer note, my oncology nurses ROCKED!!!
 Thanks for listening. :-)

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/265949/did-anyone-else-have-similar-symptoms,"Around mid November i had extreme bloating. It was really bad and came on randomly. I have had this once before back in May, accompanied by lower abdominal pains due to being constipated. One visit to the doctor, and he prescribed me something that helps with constipation/bloating/constipation pain, and within 5 days all bloating and pain was gone, and i never once experienced this again until November. In December i found out i was pregnant, and went to the ER due to some really bad lower abdominal/pelvic pain, and really bad back pain. During this visit, they took a urine sample, which came back with +2 blood in the urine. The doctor at the time said i had blood in my urine because i was pregnant. About a week after the ER visit, i went to the ER again due to cramping and bleeding, and i had a miscarriage. My urine test results from the ER came back testing negative for everything they test for, i.e. protein in urine and all that stuff, so that rules out all infections, and i thought maybe my symptoms were due to pregnancy, but i am not pregnant anymore, and the symptoms still remain.The bloating/constipation actually seemed to subside during my pregnancy, but since i miscarried it has come back. A transvaginal ultra sound during my ER visit did show that i had a cyst, but they said that it was very small, and they did not see it as any cause of concern as they are very common during pregnancy, and usually disappear on their own. I went back to a doctor a few days ago, as the blood in the urine has been in the back of my mind, and the other symptoms are still present. I assumed that if blood in the urine was due to early miscarriage bleeding, it would be gone by now seems it has been over a week or so, and sure enough, i still have blood in my urine and tested negative for all the stuff that shows some sort of infection. I went to one of those urgent care places which i feel was a complete waste of time seems he prescribed me meds for a UTI, and my urinalysis was negative for nitrites, but i feel they felt they have to give me something. A few days ago i had my well woman exam, so i told my OB about the urinary symptoms and she has ordered a urine test and urine culture. I feel a complete idiot, but i never thought to mention the constipation/bloating/back pain to my OBGYN, as i was thinking of going to a gastroenologist to see if i was having some digestion issues, but then yesterday i started looking further into my symptoms, and i have every symptom of ovarian cancer. I am in no way saying i have cancer, but i do have symptoms that are very worrisome to me. The problem is, due to my age, pregnancy, and then sadly after miscarriage, i feel that all doctors i see are relating my symptoms to those things, and i really do feel that it could be a problem they are overlooking. I am not sure if i should wait for my OBGYN to get back to me with the urine results, and for me to bring up my other symtpoms, or whether i should go to a GP. My back pain is really bad today, and i feel sharp pains every now and then in my pelvic area, mostly on the left side, and sometimes on the right. I have increased gas, my urination issue are still present, a little bloating, tiredness, feeling full very quickley, and nauseous. I am so scared, and i want to find out what the issue is fast, and my OBGYN said it make take a few days to get the urine culture testing back, but i really don't want to wait any longer. My back pain is just so bad. I was wondering if anyone else had these symptoms?

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/265695/neurotic-newbee,"Long story short, in 2011 I had a hysterectomy, everything taken out was cancer free but I had microscopic cells. This happened one year after my husband died. My CA was 33. Had seven treatments and my CA went down to 6. I was in remission for 1 year 2 months. CA was 77 so I started chemo 10-2-13. I had two treatments of Taxotere. The doctor switched me to Doxil. My CA went down to 44 after two treatments of Taxotere but now after two treatments of Doxil my CA is 88. Since taking Doxil my fingers feel like sausages and when I bend them they burn. 
 I was told that I had an aggressive cancer. What I still do not understand when I started chemo again the cells were once again microscopic and there were only two cells on the cat scan. 
 After hearing that my CA increased to 88 yesterday I was and still am petrified. I am 71 years young and I always wanted to live to 92. The doctor told me that I could continue chemo until I wanted to stop. At the start of the second round he did say that this was a recurring cancer and now it is aggressive. I still cannot believe this is happening. All I did today was live in a blown up anxiety. I was wondering why I was dizzy - guess what I didn‚Äôt eat. DUH.
 I live on a farm and raise sheep. Friends of mine have their seven baby pigs in my pigpen. They pay for the feed and I do the feeding and fresh water. When they are grown my payment is a pig ready for the freezer. I do keep busy but all I can see now is not being able to do anything. Just sitting around ready to die.
 I don‚Äôt mean to sound morbid but I am at the bottom of my barrel.
 I had a wonderful attitude about this cancer journey vowing I would not let it kill me. Maybe I am just going through a bad time and will bounce back tomorrow. 
 Just a short ps I did start reading quite a few other sites and when I was telling my doctor about them he said I was only allowed to go on the American Cancer Society site so here I am. Also for fun I bought eyeball stickers and I put two of them on the back of my head and have had a ball wearing them. I truly do have eyes on the back of my head.

https://csn.cancer.org/discussion/265583/need-hope-strength,"Friday b4 Xmas I went to General Doctor for what I assumed she was going to tell me was gas, that I had been experiencing for 32 hours. She did blood work and a CT scan. And came back into the room with my husband that they called from work to come in when they gave me the news that it looks like ovarian cancer. I was in total shock and heard nothing else. Monday b4 xmas I was calm enought to call the dr office back, and asked a few more questions. They said the mass/tumor/cyst is on my right ovary and is 21cmx11cmx11cm and that the radiology report said it was ""complex in nature"". They had not gotten my blood results back yet. On the first day they had immediately made an appointment for me to see an OBGYN/Oconologist. Due to the holidays I don't see that doctor until the 2nd of the new year. I have been a nervous wreck. I feel totally fine, however every ache and pain worries me that cancer has spread. A friend of mine told me without a biopsy there is no dx of cancer and i try to keep that as my mantra but I am still having trouble dealing with this. I am 40 years old, with 3 boys still at home in school. I have no family history of any cancer at all. I am overweight with most of it in my belly. I have had terribbly irradic periods all of my life, sometimes bleeding for a full 3 weeks and sometimes not having one at all for 6 months. Sometimes extremly heavy sometimes very minimal. Again I do feel good and until i went to the doc i never even thought i had anything wrong. i do now have minimal pain/pressure on my right side but othere than that I feel great. Except for the fact that I feel like I have been given a death sentence. And I all I can think about is that I want to see my boys grow up. I am reaching out for hope and strength.",friday b4 xmas i went to general doctor for what i assumed she was going to tell me was gas that i had been experiencing for 32 hours she did blood work and a ct scan and came back into the room with my husband that they called from work to come in when they gave me the news that it looks like ovarian cancer i was in total shock and heard nothing else monday b4 xmas i was calm enought to call the dr office back and asked a few more questions they said the masstumorcyst is on my right ovary and is 21cmx11cmx11cm and that the radiology report said it was complex in nature they had not gotten my blood results back yet on the first day they had immediately made an appointment for me to see an obgynoconologist due to the holidays i dont see that doctor until the 2nd of the new year i have been a nervous wreck i feel totally fine however every ache and pain worries me that cancer has spread a friend of mine told me without a biopsy there is no dx of cancer and i try to keep that as my mantra but i am still having trouble dealing with this i am 40 years old with 3 boys still at home in school i have no family history of any cancer at all i am overweight with most of it in my belly i have had terribbly irradic periods all of my life sometimes bleeding for a full 3 weeks and sometimes not having one at all for 6 months sometimes extremly heavy sometimes very minimal again i do feel good and until i went to the doc i never even thought i had anything wrong i do now have minimal painpressure on my right side but othere than that i feel great except for the fact that i feel like i have been given a death sentence and i all i can think about is that i want to see my boys grow up i am reaching out for hope and strength,not mentioned,Yes,High,"nervous wreck, every ache and pain worries me, minimal pain/pressure on my right side, feel like I have been given a death sentence",none
