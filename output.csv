N/A,"CASE REPORT A case of bullous fixed drug eruption caused by tadalafil Jane Sun Zhang, MD, Ishita Aggarwal, BA, and Michelle Bain, MD Key words: drug reactions; fixed drug eruption; tadalafil. INTRODUCTION Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a cutaneous adverse drug reaction characterized by the emergence of erythematous to violaceous, round to oval patcheswith a dusky center at a fixed location following theingestion of specific medications. 1In some in- stances, these lesions may also manifest as vesiclesand/or bullae. 1FDE can present as solitary, multiple, or generalized lesions. While the onset of FDE afterdrug ingestion can occur within weeks, it may develop within 48 hours, especially for cases of re- exposure. Though acute inflammation subsideswithin days to weeks, postinflammatory hyperpig-mentation may persist. 1FDE can be triggered by a wide range of drugs, which have been well-documented in the literature. Notably, tadalafil, aphosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor FDA-approved fortreating erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, has recently been reported in 3 cases. While it is legally available only by prescription, itcan be acquired by numerous other methods and hasbeen found in over-the-counter honey-based sexualenhancement supplements. 2 We present here a case of bullous FDE likely caused by tadalafil. According to literature review, thisrepresents the fourth reported case of FDE associated with tadalafil exposure. However, unlike the other cases, in this 1, the patient’s skin lesions can beattributed to tadalafil in an over-the-counter supple-ment. This case underscores the significance ofobtaining a comprehensive patient history, includingthe use of over-the-counter supplements and non-prescribed medications, to ascertain the source ofcutaneous drug reactions.CASE REPORT A well-appearing 29-year-old male presented to dermatology clinic with painful bullae that appeared4 days earlier, 1 hour after taking liquid tadalafil obtained from a friend....","CASE REPORT A case of bullous fixed drug eruption caused by tadalafil Jane Sun Zhang, MD, Ishita Aggarwal, BA, and Michelle Bain, MD Key words: drug reactions; fixed drug eruption; tadalafil.
